Day 1: Crossing Borders, Tasting History, Chasing Legends
Dordrecht to Dinant
Starting from the Pearl of the Dutch Golden Age
We leave Dordrecht, one of the Netherlands' most historically significant cities. Founded in 1008, this ancient city served as the residence of the counts of Holland until 1203 and earned its city charter in 1220, making it among the oldest cities in the Netherlands. As you prepare to depart, take a moment to appreciate where you're standing—at the convergence of the Merwede, Noord, Oude Maas, and Dordtse Kil rivers, where medieval trade routes once flowed like arteries of commerce.
The Gothic Grote Kerk tower dominates the skyline at 79 meters tall, its four large clocks making it one of the highest church towers in the Netherlands. This towering presence has watched over centuries of merchants and travellers, just as it watches over you today as you begin your journey into Belgium's heartland.
The Town That Broke Geography
Your first destination defies logic and geography in equal measure. Baarle-Nassau encloses 22 small Belgian enclaves of Baarle-Hertog, with the two largest containing seven Dutch counter-enclaves—a medieval land dispute between the Count of Breda and the Duke of Brabant that created today's geographical wonder.
The famous house that sits equally in both countries bears two numbers: 2 in Belgium and 19 in the Netherlands, with owners allowed to choose their municipality. White crosses painted on the ground mark where you're literally stepping between countries, and the stories here are as entertaining as they are bewildering. Some restaurants had to close earlier on the Dutch side, so customers simply moved to tables on the Belgian side to keep drinking. During COVID-19, a Belgian citizen living metres from an open Dutch bar couldn't patronise it due to different restrictions. Many fireworks shops cluster in Baarle-Hertog thanks to more lenient Belgian laws.
Amidst this geographical chaos, you'll also spot a WWI mast—a remnant of the German communication network that supported their border control operations. These telegraph and communication posts were essential for coordinating the infamous "Wire of Death" system, allowing German forces to monitor and control the electric fence that stretched along the Belgian-Dutch border. The mast stands as a stark reminder of how the occupying forces needed sophisticated communication systems to maintain their deadly barrier, transforming this quirky border town into a strategic military outpost during the war years.
Echoes of the Wire of Death
As you continue south, the mood shifts dramatically at the memorial site of WWI's most sinister innovation. Here, the Germans built over 200 kilometres of 2,000-volt wire ranging from 1.5 to 3 metres high, spanning the Dutch-Belgian border from Aix-la-Chapelle to the River Scheldt. Anyone within 100-500 metres could be shot on sight, yet local ingenuity prevailed—residents from Baarle used wooden beer barrels to hold up the electric fencing so they could climb underneath.
This deadly barrier claimed over 1,000 lives during the war, as desperate Belgians attempted to escape to neutral Netherlands. The memorial posts and information boards mark this haunting piece of history, built to prevent volunteers and spies from reaching the British secret service in Rotterdam. Standing here, you're witnessing how borders can transform from mere lines on maps into barriers of life and death.
Monastic Traditions at Averbode Abbey
Your lunch stop brings you to a 900-year-old abbey where tradition meets taste in the most delightful way. Averbode Abbey isn't just a historical site—it's a living monastery where monks continue their spiritual and artisanal work, creating a welcoming experience centre where traditional crafts flourish once again.
Near the entrance to the church, you'll find their superb shop offering artisan bread made using centuries-old recipes, creamy abbey cheese crafted on-site, and gingerbread made with a process that involves resting the dough for more than a week before adding walnuts and herbs for slow baking. The monks also brew Averbode beer using traditional methods, and you can gather these treasures for a perfect monastery picnic on the grounds.
Through the Heathlands to the Meuse
The afternoon ride from Averbode to Namur gradually transitions from the flat farmlands of Flemish Brabant into the rolling hills of the Condroz region.
As you approach Namur, the landscape becomes more dramatic, with wooded ridges and river valleys. The ride perfectly captures Belgium's geographical diversity, taking you from monastic tranquillity through varied countryside to the strategic river confluence that made Namur so important throughout history.
Strategic Views at Namur Citadel
The afternoon brings you to one of Europe's largest and most historically significant fortresses, perched high above the confluence of the Sambre and Meuse rivers. This strategic position at the meeting of two major waterways has made Namur a prize worth fighting for throughout history. Because of its strategic position at the head of routes into France, Namur was the scene of a number of battles and sieges, whilst in World War I, Namur was a major target of the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, which sought to use the Meuse valley as a route into France.
The citadel's importance stems from its control over these vital river corridors—the Meuse flowing north to the Netherlands and the Sambre providing access from the east. Occupying a strategic position between France and the Burgundian (later Spanish) Netherlands, the citadel was enlarged several times, and besieged several times too, on one occasion (1692) by Louis XIV. Because of its strategic location, Namur was frequently besieged. In the War of the Grand Alliance it fell (1692) to the French, but was retaken by the Dutch in 1695.
The citadel is originally from the Roman era, but has been rebuilt several times. Its current form was designed by Menno van Coehoorn, and improved upon by Vauban after the siege of 1692, and its highest point sits at 190 metres (620 ft). The history here spans over two millennia. The citadel was the site of the Celtic Oppidum Aduatucorum where Julius Caesar defeated the Belgic Gauls, it developed into a Roman stronghold against Germanic invasions in the 3rd and 4th century. In the 10th century, the Count of Namur replaced the Roman ruins by a wooden tower. The first part was built in the Middle Ages and gradually evolved into a true fortified castle.
What makes this fortress truly remarkable is its vast underground network. Its 7 km of underground tunnels make it one of the biggest fortresses in Europe, earning it the nickname "Europe's Termite Mound." The citadel on a rock located above the town was originally the castle of the counts of Namur; it was fortified in the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries before being abandoned in 1862.
The visitor centre offers panoramic views over the Ardennes and interactive exhibits about the fortress's turbulent history, making it the perfect spot for refreshments before your final push to Dinant. Within easy reach of the town centre, it offers gorgeous viewpoints over the city and the Meuse valley, and you can truly appreciate why this strategic position has been so fiercely contested throughout history.
The Legend Lives in Stone
As you approach Dinant, prepare for one of Belgium's most legendary landmarks. The Bayard Rock rises dramatically from the Meuse River, steeped in medieval legend and named after the magical horse from the tale of the Four Sons of Aymon. According to the story, Bayard could grow to accommodate all four Aymon brothers on his back, and when pursued by Charlemagne's army, made a tremendous leap from this rock across the Meuse River to escape—his hoofprint supposedly still visible in the stone.
This massive limestone outcrop offers spectacular views of the surrounding Ardennes and has inspired artists and writers for centuries. While legend credits Bayard's mighty hooves with creating the gap, it's more likely that Louis XIV's army widened this natural cleft to create a strategic military route during their campaigns in the region. Today, as you ride past this towering natural monument, you're experiencing the same dramatic landscape that has captured imaginations for over a thousand years—where medieval legend meets military practicality carved in stone.
Arriving in the Saxophone's Birthplace
Dinant unfolds along the shores of the Meuse River in the Ardennes, 90 kilometres southeast of Brussels and just 20 kilometres north of the French border. This remarkable town claims multiple famous offspring: Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone, was born here in 1814, and the world-famous Leffe beer has called this place home since 1240.
The Gothic Collégiale Notre-Dame rises with its distinctive bulbous spire, while above the church towers the vertical flank of the rocky outcrop crowned by the citadel, rebuilt in 1821. A flight of 408 steps leads up from the church for those brave enough to climb, while saxophone sculptures scattered throughout the town pay homage to their famous son.
The Journey's Rhythm
Throughout today's ride, you'll witness a fascinating transformation. Border crossings reveal subtle shifts in landscape and architecture, from Dutch brick houses to Belgian stone buildings. Language signs evolve from Dutch to Flemish to French as you travel south, while the cuisine culture transforms from Dutch to Belgian influences. The flat Dutch polders gradually give way to the rolling hills of the Ardennes, each mile bringing new discoveries.
As evening approaches in Dinant, the town becomes magical at sunset with the citadel and church illuminated against the river. The riverside promenade offers perfect shots of the dramatic landscape that inspired countless artists, while local cafés serve Leffe beer and traditional Ardennes specialties. You've journeyed through borders both real and imagined, tasted history in monastic bread and cheese, and followed legends carved in stone—a perfect introduction to the wonders that await on your Belgian adventure.
Day 2: Dinant to Zweibrücken
From Belgian Pastries to German Monasteries - A Castle-Hopping Adventure
Morning Ride: Dinant to Houffalize
Your day begins with a scenic ride from Dinant through the heart of the Belgian Ardennes to Houffalize, one of Belgium's most charming highland towns. The route takes you along winding roads through dense forests and rolling hills, where the landscape transforms from the Meuse Valley's limestone cliffs to the higher elevations of the Ardennes plateau.
Morning Stop: Valentine Boulangerie-Pâtisserie, Houffalize
Arrive at this charming local bakery in Houffalize, where Valentine Boulangerie promises "a warm and comforting moment" with traditional Belgian pastries and breads. This perfect spot offers grab-and-go options for the road ahead, featuring local favourites that deliver authentic Belgian flavours alongside fresh coffee to fuel your continued journey through three countries. Houffalize, nestled in the Ardennes highlands, provides the perfect transition point from Belgian valleys to Luxembourg's ancient castle country.
Scenic Route: Esch-sur-Sûre, Luxembourg
As you ride through the stunning Luxembourg countryside, you'll encounter one of Europe's most picturesque castle ruins. Esch-sur-Sûre is situated in a perfect horseshoe bend of the Sûre River, with the village nestled beneath the ruins of Luxembourg's oldest castle. The ancient fortress foundations date back to 927, when Maingaud and his wife Hiletrude from the Abbey in Stavelot acquired this strategic position to build their fortified castle.
Built in 927 and enlarged in the 13th century, the castle commanded the river crossing until Louis XIV's troops dismantled it in 1685. The ruins are dramatically illuminated at night, creating a magical silhouette that's become one of Luxembourg's most photographed medieval scenes. The village below offers incredible valley views from the castle ruins perched high above, making this an essential photo stop for motorcycle touring through the Ardennes.

Route Highlight: Bourscheid Castle
Luxembourg's largest medieval fortress awaits as you continue through the Sûre Valley. Bourscheid Castle is an impressive triangular structure with characteristic round towers, representing a masterpiece of medieval engineering. Situated on a steep promontory 150 meters high above the Sûre River, this fortress is accessible only from the northwest, making it nearly impregnable during its heyday.
Construction began in 1095 on the site of an earlier wooden fort that was transformed into stone around the year 1000. The Gothic style architecture creates beautiful scenery in the mountains, while Roman structures identified beneath medieval foundations reveal continuous occupation spanning over a millennium. The castle's strategic importance cannot be overstated - it commanded the entire Sûre Valley and controlled ancient trade routes through the Ardennes.
The approach to Bourscheid offers some of the most spectacular motorcycle touring scenery in Luxembourg. Winding roads through pristine forests provide glimpses of the castle towers above, while the valley roads follow the river's meandering course through limestone cliffs and medieval villages. This section perfectly captures the essence of European castle-hopping by motorcycle.
Lunch Stop: Vianden, Luxembourg
Welcome to one of Europe's most beautiful small towns, where medieval fairy tales come to life. Vianden is dominated by one of the largest fortified castles west of the Rhine, perfectly restored to its medieval glory between 1977 and 1986. The castle is considered one of the most beautiful feudal residences of the Roman and Gothic periods in Europe, combining Gothic windows and Renaissance galleries with a massive 11th-century keep.
Victor Hugo stayed here multiple times during his exile and called Vianden "a jewel in a green casket." His house is now a museum showcasing his love affair with this magical place, where he wrote extensively about the town's beauty. The castle's impressive great hall and medieval kitchens tell stories of noble life, while the charming old town with its narrow cobblestone streets provides the perfect backdrop for a flexible lunch approach.
The chairlift offers panoramic views when weather permits, revealing the stunning Our Valley spread below. For those brave enough, the medieval torture chamber provides a sobering reminder of darker times, while the castle's position offers commanding views over the valley that once made it such a strategic stronghold.
Afternoon Treat: Tholeis - Die Eisbar, Tholey
Nestled in Tholey's market square, this delightful ice cream haven provides the perfect cool treat after exploring one of Germany's most significant religious sites. Tholey Abbey, located in Saarland, is widely recognised as Germany's oldest monastery, with roots tracing back to the 7th century when early clerics established themselves among Roman ruins.
Germany's Oldest Monastery: A Living Heritage
The first historical mention of Tholey Abbey comes from a document recorded in 634, though communities existed here as early as the 5th and 6th centuries. Saint Wendelin is counted by tradition as the first abbot of this ancient foundation at the foot of the Schaumberg. The first traces of settlement in the area go back to the Celts, with multiple archaeological finds showing extended Roman occupation, making this a site of continuous habitation for over 1,500 years.
The current Gothic structure dates to the 13th century, lovingly restored and maintained by the current Benedictine community. In 1794, much of the abbey was burned down amid the French Revolution, but the community's resilience ensured its reconstruction. The abbey recently gained international attention for its stunning Gerhard Richter stained glass windows, where contemporary art meets ancient spirituality in perfect harmony.
Evening Arrival: Zweibrücken, Germany
Your overnight destination is this charming German city whose name literally means "Two Bridges," referring to the bridges over the rivers Schwarzbach and Hornbach that meet here. Known as the Rose City, Zweibrücken is home to Europe's largest rose garden with over 60,000 rose bushes and 2,000 varieties, spectacular from May to October.
As the former seat of the Counts Palatine of Zweibrücken, the city showcases a beautiful blend of baroque and modern German architecture. The historic old town invites evening strolls, while local restaurants serve Palatinate wines and regional cuisine that reflect the area's unique position near the French border. This cultural blend appears in everything from cuisine and architecture to local dialect, where French influences mix with German traditions.
Today's Geographic and Cultural Journey
Your route covers approximately 280 kms through dramatically changing terrain, from Belgian Ardennes through Luxembourg's rolling hills to German Palatinate flatlands. The journey takes you through three distinct cultural regions, each with its own architectural traditions and historical legacy.
The border crossings are seamless in the modern EU, marked only by subtle changes in road signs and architecture. Languages evolve from French through Luxembourgish and German dialects to pure German, while castle architecture transforms from Belgian fortress-towns to Luxembourg's river-valley strongholds to German monastery-fortresses.
The landscape progression tells Europe's geological story - ancient river valleys carved by glacial action give way to Germanic forests and eventually to the Rhine plain. Each region's motorcycle roads offer unique characteristics, from the winding valley routes of Luxembourg to the flowing countryside roads of the German Palatinate.
Road Conditions and Riding Notes
Weather can change quickly in the Ardennes, particularly around castle sites situated on elevated positions. The German Palatinate section features gentler terrain with good visibility and flowing roads that make for relaxed touring. Border regions may have varying speed limits and road regulations, though differences are minimal within the EU zone.

Day 3: Zweibrücken to Sigmaringen
France's Favourite Village, Black Forest Legends & Hohenzollern Royalty
Morning Stop: Maginot Line Fort Schoenenbourg
Begin your French adventure with one of Europe's most fascinating military fortifications. Fort Schoenenbourg, built between 1931 and 1935, represents the pinnacle of the Maginot Line's defensive engineering. This underground fortress extends 30 meters below ground and stretches over 3 kms in length, designed to house 630 men for up to three months of siege.
The fort's ingenious design included everything from underground railways and hospitals to power plants and ammunition factories. Walking through its corridors, you'll experience the claustrophobic reality of 1940s warfare and understand why this line of fortifications was considered impregnable. The guided tour reveals the daily life of soldiers who lived entirely underground, complete with original equipment, weapons, and living quarters that tell the story of France's last line of defence before World War II.
Cost 10 Euros
Village Visit: Hunspach, Alsace France
After the sobering reality of military history, immerse yourself in one of the most enchanting villages in Europe. In 2020, Hunspach was voted "Village préféré des Français" and you'll immediately understand why. The main street unfolds like a fairy tale with imposing white half-timbered houses adorned with cascading geraniums. This architectural perfection represents the unique Alsatian blend of French and German influences, where history tells itself through distinctive white walls and dark wooden beams.
Located in the Outre-Forêt region near Wissembourg, Hunspach offers living history through its architecture, costumes, and traditions. The village church with its distinctive spire creates perfect photo opportunities alongside the symmetrical half-timbered houses and overflowing window boxes. Notice how street signs appear in both French and German, reflecting Alsace's complex history of changing hands between the two nations. The contrast between the fort's military tensions and the village's peaceful beauty perfectly captures Alsace's complex past.
Lunch: Allerheiligen, Black Forest
Enter one of the Black Forest's most mystical locations where haunting monastery ruins meet magnificent waterfalls. The Allerheiligen monastery, founded between 1191 and 1196 by Uta von Schauenburg, carries a dramatic history of repeated destruction by lightning and fire. Since the late 13th century, pilgrims have journeyed here for All Saints Day, drawn by the monastery's legendary atmosphere.
The Lierbach cuts through granite here, creating spectacular waterfalls that cascade 66 meters down seven drops within the Schwarzwald National Park. These are among the largest natural waterfalls in the northern Black Forest, where Gothic arches and stone walls tell stories of medieval monastic life. The interplay of light and shadow through the Black Forest canopy creates an almost fairy-tale atmosphere perfect for lunch surrounded by history, legend, and natural beauty.
The Enchanted Schwarzwald: Where Legends Are Born
The name 'Black Forest' or 'Schwarzwald' comes from the dense canopy of conifer trees that blocks out sunlight, creating dark, mysterious depths that inspired the Brothers Grimm tales of 'Hansel and Gretel' and 'Rapunzel'. Ancient Germanic tribes believed these woods were home to gods, elves, and spectral beings, with Middle Ages legends transforming into tales of haunted castles, cursed villages, and mischievous goblins.
Legends tell of lost souls who roam the woods, ephemeral figures seeking resolution and redemption, drawn to the shadowy silhouettes of the trees. The mysterious Mummelsee lake is said to be inhabited by water spirits called "Nix" who guard ancient secrets. Often, fog rolls in like a blanket, covering the forest in an otherworldly atmosphere that has inspired countless tales of supernatural encounters.
Beyond the legends, the Black Forest represents centuries of German craftsmanship and tradition. In the late 17th century, farmers used logs from the forest to build the world's first cuckoo clocks during winter months to supplement their income. In 1738, Franz Ketterer from Schönwald village was the first to build a cuckoo for his clocks, inspired by the large artist's clocks with calling roosters in towns like Prague and Strasbourg.
Today, Black Forest cuckoo clocks are still made in the traditional style that began hundreds of years ago, with skilled artisans dedicating their lives to the clockmaking craft. The region's abundance of natural resources - plentiful forest wood and local iron ore deposits - created the perfect union of nature and human endeavour. The intricate woodcarvings featuring leaves, birds, deer, and hunting scenes continue to represent the deep connection between the forest's natural beauty and its cultural heritage.
Through the Swabian Alps
After leaving the mystical depths of the Black Forest, your route climbs toward the Swabian Alps. The landscape opens dramatically as you approach Schloss Glatt, revealing rolling hills dotted with traditional German farmhouses. This is classic Baden-Württemberg countryside - green pastures, scattered forests, and castle-topped hills creating picture-perfect scenes.
Refreshment: Cafe im Schloss, Glatt
After the mystical atmosphere of Allerheiligen, enjoy civilised coffee culture in this extraordinary water castle. Originated in 13th century this castle is now a treasure trove complex consisting of a park area, moat, several buildings, two museums, and a cafeteria with home-made German cakes. It is recognised as one of the oldest Renaissance castles in southern Germany and is among the few preserved moated castles in the state of Baden-Württemberg.
Wasserschloss Glatt: A Renaissance Jewel
The moated castle Glatt used to be the residence of the von Neuneck family, today it houses a total of four museums. The 13th century castle was converted into a Renaissance style in 1533-1540 under the vision of Reinhard von Neuneck, who transformed the medieval water fortress into one of Germany's earliest Renaissance palaces.
Comprising of three wings, the castle underwent numerous renovations under the reign of Reinhard von Neuneck. The large castle complex also has a chapel embellished in stucco design. The von Neuneck family owned this remarkable estate from the 13th century until 1671, creating a legacy that represents the transition from medieval fortification to Renaissance elegance.
The castle's moat serves as more than just a defensive feature - it creates a mirror-like reflection of the Renaissance architecture, making it one of the most photographed water castles in Germany. Currently, it houses a local cultural centre, where you can see amber exhibitions, ethnographic and historical exhibitions devoted to the Glatt region.
What makes this stop particularly special is the traditional German Konditorei (confectionery) with handmade pastries operating within the castle walls. You're perfectly positioned to try authentic Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte in its homeland while enjoying castle views and the peaceful atmosphere of this Renaissance masterpiece surrounded by water
Scenic Highlight: Burg Hohenzollern
As you ride past this magnificent fortress perched 855 meters above sea level, you'll witness one of Germany's most spectacular castles. This neo-Gothic reconstruction serves as the ancestral seat of the Prussian royal house and the princes of Hohenzollern. The dramatic hilltop setting and fairy-tale appearance have earned it the title "the most beautiful castle in Germany."
Home to the Hohenzollern dynasty that ruled Prussia and later the German Empire, the current castle is the third to occupy this site and contains the Prussian Crown Jewels. The approach road offers stunning views of the castle's silhouette against the Swabian Alps, with multiple viewpoints for spectacular photos without entering the grounds.
Danube Valley Descent
The final stretch descends into the Danube valley, where the river begins its 2,850-kilometer journey to the Black Sea. The valley roads are gentle and flowing, following the river's course through limestone cliffs and medieval towns. As you approach Sigmaringen, the castle's dramatic position becomes apparent - perched on a narrow limestone ridge that seems to grow directly from the Danube's banks.
Overnight: Sigmaringen
Your overnight stop is dominated by another magnificent Hohenzollern castle. Sigmaringen Castle, the former princely residence and administrative seat of the Princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, towers on a 200-meter-long limestone cliff that rises 35 meters above the Danube River. The impressive fortress continues to serve as the residence and administrative seat of the noble Hohenzollern family after nearly a thousand years.
The castle's strategic position high above the Danube creates a dramatic evening atmosphere, especially when illuminated at night. Stroll along the Danube River promenade and explore the historic old town with its traditional German architecture. Here you'll find excellent Swabian cuisine featuring local specialties like Maultaschen and Spätzle.
Standing beside the famous Danube River, you're at the beginning of Europe's second-longest river's journey through ten countries to the Black Sea. This connection to the greater European waterway system adds another layer to your cultural journey.
Day 4: Sigmaringen to Grainau
The Royal Castles & Alpine Lakes Route
Distance: ~200km | Riding Time: 4-5 hours + stops
Your day begins at Sigmaringen, where the imposing castle perches dramatically above the Danube River like a scene from a medieval romance. This isn't just any fortress—it's been home to the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family for over 600 years, housing relatives of the last German Kaiser and containing one of Europe's finest private art collections. Built in 1077 and expanded into its current dramatic form in 1893, the castle holds remarkable historical significance, having served as the seat of the Vichy French government-in-exile from 1944 to 1945, and from where the Hohenzollerns ruled Romania until 1947.
The castle's armoury contains 3,000 weapons—one of Europe's largest collections—and its dramatic silhouette against the Danube cliffs provides a memorable backdrop as you begin your journey toward the Alps.
Through Authentic Swabian Country
Our coffee stop in Waltershofen offers a glimpse into authentic Swabian culture, where the local bakery serves genuine Streuselkuchen (crumb cake) and strong German coffee. This tiny village embodies the Swabian character—frugal, hardworking, and inventive. The famous Swabian saying "Schaffe, schaffe, Häusle baue" (Work, work, build a little house) reflects the regional mentality that gave birth to the automobile industry, with both Mercedes-Benz and Porsche originating in this industrious corner of Germany.
Into the Allgäu Alps
The Alpsee near Immenstadt im Allgäu marks your entry into the legendary Allgäu region, where Alpine culture meets Bavarian tradition. This pristine lake, sitting at 723 meters elevation, is surrounded by gentle peaks that will soon grow into towering Alps. The name "Allgäu" means "Alpine meadow," and you'll understand why as you ride through this landscape of wooden chalets with flower-filled balconies and rolling green hills dotted with contented cows producing Germany's finest cheeses.
The perfectly maintained roads here offer stunning lake views and countless photo opportunities, setting the stage for the dramatic mountain scenery ahead.
Mountain Spa Culture in Bad Hindelang
Bad Hindelang has been a health resort since 1922, famous for its pure mountain air and healing springs discovered by a local shepherd whose flock kept returning to drink from a particular spot. The town sits in a dramatic valley surrounded by peaks over 2,000 meters high, where traditional "Schrothkur" (hay bath therapy) is still practiced and wartime resistance fighters once hid in mountain caves.
The Austrian Island in Germany
One of Europe's strangest borders awaits as you pass through Jungholz, technically Austrian territory but completely surrounded by Germany, connected to Austria by just a single point on a mountain peak. This community of 300 people uses German postal codes and phone numbers while following Austrian laws but German customs—a perfect example of Europe's complex medieval borders that survived into the modern era.
The Romantic Road's Hidden Gem
The eastern shore of Forggensee reveals a surprising secret—this timelessly Alpine lake is actually artificial, created in 1954 but looking as natural as if glaciers carved it millennia ago. The route along the eastern shore offers spectacular castle views across the water, with traditional Maibaum (May poles) in every village telling each town's story through carved symbols.
Photography enthusiasts will find gold here, especially from the eastern shore looking west, where the lake's waters frame distant castles perfectly. In winter, the lake drains completely for maintenance, creating a surreal sight that few visitors ever witness.
Dining with Kings in Schwangau
Our lunch at Schlossbrauhaus Schwangau positions us perfectly between Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau castles. This isn't tourist kitsch—it's a working brewery with over 500 years of history, where King Ludwig II regularly ate, preferring simple food despite his extravagant castle building. The royal connection adds flavour to every bite of Schweinebraten (roast pork) with sauerkraut, accompanied by Schwangauer Bier brewed using water from the same springs that supply the castles.
Don't miss the Kaiserschmarrn—sweet pancake dish named after Emperor Franz Joseph.
The Mad King's Fairy Tale Legacy
Neuschwanstein Castle stands as "Mad" King Ludwig II's masterpiece and the inspiration for Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle. Built between 1869 and 1886, this architectural fantasy cost 6.2 million marks (equivalent to €200 million today) and featured revolutionary amenities including central heating, running water, and even a telephone system. Ludwig died mysteriously before its completion, found drowned in Lake Starnberg under suspicious circumstances, having slept in his dream castle only 172 nights.
The castle was built as homage to composer Richard Wagner, whose operas obsessed Ludwig, particularly the medieval legend of Lohengrin, the Swan Knight. Swans appear everywhere in the castle's decorations, connecting it to its neighbouring Hohenschwangau Castle, Ludwig's childhood home built by his father King Maximilian II in 1837. This is where Ludwig developed his romantic obsessions with medieval legends and Wagner's music that would define his tragic reign.
Today, Neuschwanstein receives 1.4 million visitors annually, but the best photographs come from Marienbrücge (Mary's Bridge), a dramatic span requiring just a 10-minute hike from the parking area. The view from this bridge captures the castle's impossible beauty against the Alpine backdrop that inspired Ludwig's vision.
The Turquoise Jewel
South along Plansee, you'll encounter one of Europe's most beautiful lakes, its intense turquoise colour created by glacier-ground limestone particles suspended in the water. This natural wonder stretches 6 kms long and reaches depths of 78 meters, fed by underground springs and mountain streams that keep water temperatures rarely exceeding 20°C even in summer.
The lake straddles the German-Austrian border, and your route follows ancient Roman roads where legions once marched to conquer Germanic tribes. The historical continuity adds depth to the stunning scenery, connecting your modern journey to 2,000 years of travellers who passed this way.
Ettal Abbey: Bavarian Baroque Masterpiece
Founded in 1330 by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV, Ettal Abbey ranks among Bavaria's most important monasteries. Legend tells that the emperor's horse knelt three times at this spot, inspiring him to establish the monastery. The current baroque church, built in 1745, houses a miraculous statue of the Virgin Mary and features an optical illusion dome painted to appear much higher than it actually is.
The monastery survived dissolution under Napoleon and continues producing Ettaler Klosterlikör, a herbal liqueur made by the monks, along with Ettaler beer (brewed since 1609), cheese, and various herbal products. The baroque church represents the pinnacle of Bavarian religious architecture, its elaborate decoration contrasting beautifully with the simple Alpine landscape surrounding it.
Gateway to Germany's Highest Peak
Your day ends in Grainau, sitting at the foot of the Zugspitze at 2,962 meters, Germany's highest mountain. This traditional Bavarian village offers perfect Alpine atmosphere after your royal castle day, with traditional Gemütlichkeit (cozy atmosphere) in local Gasthäuser and views of the Zugspitze glacier from your hotel window.
Summer evenings often feature traditional Bavarian Alphornbläser (Alpine horn players) performing against the mountain backdrop, their haunting melodies echoing off the peaks as the sun sets behind the snow-capped summits. The scene perfectly captures the magic of Alpine Bavaria and provides the ideal preparation for tomorrow's Alpine passes and Austrian adventures.
Route Essentials
The perfectly maintained roads offer excellent riding conditions, though mountain weather can change quickly as you gain elevation approaching the Alps.
Castle visits require advance booking during peak season, and parking can be challenging at Neuschwanstein, so plan accordingly. The route combines smooth highway sections with winding mountain roads, making it suitable for all skill levels while providing enough variety to keep experienced riders engaged.
Day 5: Grainau to Sankt Jakob am Thurn
The Tyrolean Alps & Eagle's Nest Route
Distance: ~280km | Riding Time: 5-6 hours + stops
Your morning begins in the shadow of the Zugspitze, Germany's highest peak at 2,962 meters, towering above Grainau like a natural cathedral. This majestic mountain marks the border between Germany and Austria, following the watershed of the Inn River valley—a natural boundary used since Roman times. Today's journey will take you across this historic frontier into the heart of the Austrian Alps.
Through the Painted Village of Mittenwald
Your first stop reveals one of the Alps' most charming traditions. Mittenwald captivates visitors with its Lüftlmalerei—elaborate painted facades that transform traditional houses into storytelling canvases. Each painting reveals something about the family or building's history: religious scenes indicate devout Catholic families, trade symbols represent family professions, coats of arms show noble connections, and hunting scenes display wealth and status.
This picturesque town sits on the ancient Roman road "Via Claudia Augusta," the same route merchants used to transport goods between Rome and the Germanic provinces. More remarkably, Mittenwald has been the violin-making capital of Germany since 1684, when Matthias Klotz brought the craft here from Cremona, Italy. The tradition continues today, with local craftsmen still using Alpine spruce and maple to create world-class instruments, and the violin museum houses 400-year-old masterpieces.
Innsbruck: Gateway to Austria
Crossing into Austria, you enter Innsbruck—literally "Bridge over the Inn River." This city has served as the gateway between northern and southern Europe for 800 years, and its imperial legacy remains visible everywhere. Emperor Maximilian I made it his favourite residence in the 1500s, and the famous Goldenes Dachl (Golden Roof) was built for his wedding celebrations, its 2,738 gilded copper tiles still shining today.
As you ride through the city, notice how the architecture transforms. Austrian Alpine style features steeper roofs designed for heavy snow loads, wooden balconies with intricate carvings, pastel-coloured facades, and the distinctive onion domes of churches becoming increasingly common. The food culture shifts as well—you're now in Schnitzel and Strudel territory, where Austrian cuisine influences become dominant.
Alpine Coffee Culture in Fügen
Stop at Café-Konditorei Edelweiß in Fügen to experience Austria's coffee culture, which rivals Vienna's even in small mountain towns. The café's name honours Austria's national flower, the rare Edelweiß, which grows only at high altitudes. Legend says this flower can only be picked by someone pure of heart, and young men once risked their lives climbing to prove their love.
Sample Austrian coffee specialties like Melange (similar to cappuccino but uniquely Austrian) or Einspänner (black coffee with whipped cream served in a glass), accompanied by traditional Sachertorte or Apfelstrudel—both Austrian inventions that have conquered the world.
Through Austria's Most Beautiful Village
West of Alpbach, you'll encounter the village that consistently wins "Austria's Most Beautiful Village" awards. Traditional wooden chalets with geranium-filled balconies create a fairy-tale atmosphere so perfect it seems almost unreal. Building regulations maintain traditional Alpine style, with no modern architecture allowed in the village centre, ensuring each house follows centuries-old Tyrolean design principles. Remarkably, this tiny Alpine paradise hosts the European Forum, where world leaders meet annually.
The Ski Resort Circuit
Riding through Wörgl, Hopfgarten, and Westendorf, you're traversing Austria's premier ski resort region—the SkiWelt Wilder Kaiser-Brixental, one of the world's largest ski areas. These mountains witnessed the birth of skiing as we know it, originally invented as transportation in these very peaks. The first ski lifts built here in the 1950s transformed tiny farming villages into international destinations.
Hopfgarten, meaning "Hop Garden," still grows hops for beer, while Westendorf hosts World Cup ski races. In summer, what are ski slopes in winter become Alpine meadows filled with wildflowers, and the famous Berglift (mountain lifts) now carry mountain bikers and hikers instead of skiers.
Kitzbühel: Home of the Hahnenkamm
Past the mysterious Schwarzsee (Black Lake), warmed by thermal springs and shrouded in medieval legend about a knight's black armour sinking after defeat in battle, you reach Kitzbühel. This town hosts the world's most dangerous ski race—the Hahnenkamm Downhill, with an 85 percent crash rate that makes it the most feared in skiing.
Kitzbühel's golden age began when Archduke Franz Ferdinand hunted here, and by the 1930s, Hollywood stars and European royalty had made it famous. The distinctive red and white striped church spire has been Kitzbühel's landmark for 700 years, and traditional Tracht (Alpine dress) is still worn daily by locals, preserving authentic mountain culture amid the glamour.
Authentic Tyrolean Life
Sankt Johann in Tirol and Fieberbrunn represent real Alpine life beyond tourist resorts—farming communities that have worked these valleys for over 1,000 years. Sankt Johann, named after John the Baptist, and Fieberbrunn, meaning "Fever Spring" after its medieval healing spa, showcase traditional Alpine farming still practiced on impossibly steep slopes.
The landscape is dotted with Heustadl (hay barns), some over 300 years old, and farming techniques remain unchanged for centuries. Each September, the ceremonial Almabtrieb brings cattle down from summer pastures in a tradition that connects modern Austria to its agricultural roots.
Lunch at the Border
Your midday meal at Wurznwirt Schneizelreuth offers a unique experience—this traditional Gasthof sits exactly on the German-Austrian border, allowing you to literally eat lunch in two countries. Border inns like this have served travellers for centuries, once providing cover for smugglers moving goods between countries. The menu serves both German and Austrian specialties, from Tafelspitz (Austrian boiled beef) with horseradish to Schweinebraten (Bavarian roast pork) with sauerkraut, finished with Kaiserschmarrn—sweet pancake shreds with plum compote.
Berchtesgaden: Complex History in an Alpine Setting
Your route through Berchtesgaden navigates complex 20th-century history alongside 900 years of peaceful Alpine culture. This area carries multiple historical layers: medieval salt mining made it incredibly wealthy with "white gold" of the Alps, from 1500 to 1803 it was an independent principality ruled by Prince-Archbishops, and from 1933 to 1945 it became Hitler's chosen location for his mountain retreat.
The Eagle's Nest (Kehlsteinhaus), built as Hitler's 50th birthday present in 1938, sits at 1,834 meters altitude as an engineering marvel of its time. Now a restaurant and historical site, it serves as a reminder of this dark period crucial to understanding modern German identity. The original bronze elevator still operates, carrying visitors who come to learn and remember.
The area's salt mining heritage runs much deeper, with the Salzbergwerk operating for over 500 years. Miners' traditional Lederhosen originated here as work clothes, and underground salt slides still operate for tourist tours. Salt trade routes once connected these Alps to the Baltic Sea, making this region one of Europe's wealthiest.
Modern Berchtesgaden focuses on environmental protection and sustainable tourism, traditional Alpine crafts and culture, and education about both natural beauty and historical responsibility. The area became Germany's first national park in 1978, representing the country's commitment to preserving Alpine wilderness.
Evening in Sankt Jakob am Thurn
Your day ends in a quiet Alpine valley village, the perfect place to process the journey through both natural beauty and complex history. The evening atmosphere embodies Gemütlichkeit—that uniquely Austrian cozy atmosphere—with traditional Gasthof hospitality, mountain views as the sun sets behind Alpine peaks, and church bells marking evening prayers with a sound unchanged for centuries.
Sample local specialties like Pinzgauer Bierfleisch (beef cooked in local beer) or Salzburger Nockerl (sweet soufflé dessert), accompanied by regional wines from the nearby Salzburg Wine Region. As you settle in for the night, the language shift becomes more apparent—Austrian dialect grows prominent, "Grüß Gott" replaces "Guten Tag" as the standard greeting, and you'll notice the softer, more melodic pronunciation that characterises Austrian German.
Essential Route Information
The border crossing remains seamless within the EU, requiring no stops, though you'll need a Vignette (highway sticker) for Austrian highways—€9.60 for 10 days. Mountain weather conditions change rapidly above 1,000 meters elevation, so carry rain gear and warm layers. Austrian fuel costs slightly more than German, but stations are regular throughout the route.
Traffic can be heavy around Kitzbühel and Berchtesgaden during summer tourist season, and mountain roads require different riding techniques as engine performance decreases with altitude. The maximum elevation reaches approximately 1,200 meters, causing no breathing concerns, but weather can change from sunny to stormy within minutes. The excellent Alpine roads include some narrow mountain sections that demand attention, but reward careful riders with spectacular photography opportunities, especially around Berchtesgaden.

Day 7: Sankt Jakob am Thurn to Heiligenblut
The Grossglockner High Alpine Road - Austria's Crown Jewel
Distance: ~160km | Riding Time: 4-5 hours + extensive stops
Your morning departure from Sankt Jakob am Thurn leads you into Salzburgerland, Mozart's homeland and one of Austria's most culturally rich provinces. The ride through the Pinzgau valley follows one of Austria's most important historical trade routes, where Celtic tribes first established the ancient path "Binu-Goujon," meaning "High Valley."
Through the Salt Empire
As you pass through Hallein, you're traveling through the source of Austria's medieval wealth. For over 4,000 years, this has been one of Europe's most important salt mining centres, where Celtic tribes first extracted "white gold" from the earth around 800 BC. The Romans expanded these operations massively, and medieval salt trade made Salzburg's Archbishops among Europe's richest rulers. The very name Salzach River means "Salt River," named after the countless barges that carried this precious cargo downstream.
The engineering marvel of Salzbergwerk Hallein includes 24 kilometers of underground tunnels, wooden slides that miners have used for over 400 years, and the world's longest wooden mining slide at 64 meters. Even today's traditional Lederhosen originated as salt miners' work clothes, while the Dirndl dresses developed from the practical clothing worn by miners' wives.
Werfen: Where Legend Meets Reality
Werfen sits dramatically beneath two of Austria's most spectacular attractions. Hohenwerfen Castle, built in 1077, perches impossibly high on a rock pinnacle, having survived 900 years of wars and sieges while housing Europe's first falconry centre. Deep beneath your feet lies the Eisriesenwelt, the world's largest ice cave system with 42 kilometers of ice formations that never melt due to constant sub-zero temperatures.
Local legend tells of the Werfen Giant, who supposedly lived in these mountains and threw rocks down at travellers. The scattered boulders in the valley are said to be his ammunition, and local children still leave bread at certain rocks to appease his spirit.
Into the Heart of the Alps
Continuing east through Mühlbach am Hochkönig, you enter the Hochkönig massif region, dominated by the dramatic 2,941-meter peak. The name Mühlbach means "Mill Stream," recalling the countless water mills that once powered early industry here using Alpine stream power. This massive limestone formation creates dramatic vertical walls as part of the Berchtesgaden Alps extension.
Stop at Bäckerei-Cafe-Konditorei Bauer to experience traditional Alpine baking heritage. Austrian mountain bakeries maintain traditions dating back centuries, where dense Bauernbrot (farmer's bread) was made to last for weeks, and the sophisticated pastry-making techniques developed in Imperial Austria spread to provincial towns through traveling apprentice bakers.
The Grossglockner Ascent
Arriving at Bruck an der Grossglocknerstrasse marks the beginning of one of the world's greatest motorcycle roads. This engineering marvel, opened in 1935, required 3,200 workers and innovative construction techniques to build 48 kms of mountain road with 36 hairpin turns, reaching 2,504 meters at Hochtor Pass.
The mandatory side trip to Edelweißspitze Summit at 2,571 meters offers 360-degree panoramic views of the Austrian Alps. This 2.5-kilometer climb with 11 percent gradients and narrow turns requires precise motorcycle control, but rewards you with views of 37 peaks over 3,000 meters on clear days. The Grossglockner, Austria's highest peak at 3,798 meters, dominates the southern horizon alongside the retreating Pasterze Glacier.
Riding the High Alpine Road
The Grossglockner High Alpine Road isn't just a road—it's a pilgrimage route for motorcyclists worldwide. The engineering follows the landscape rather than conquering it, creating a harmonious blend of human achievement and natural beauty. The northern ramp gradually ascends through traditional Alpine villages before the dramatic hairpin series climbs 800 meters through 12 consecutive turns.
Above the tree line, you enter Alpine tundra landscapes resembling Arctic conditions, where marmots whistle warnings from their rocky perches and golden eagles soar above the peaks. The Hochtor Tunnel at 2,504 meters marks your passage through the Continental Divide into Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria's largest protected area.
Cultural Transition
Descending the southern side, you cross into Carinthia, Austria's southernmost province with distinct cultural characteristics. The Carinthian German dialect becomes prominent, bilingual road signs appear, and the greeting changes from "Grüß Gott" to "Griaß di." Architectural styles shift from Germanic to show Venetian influence, reflecting centuries of trade connections to Italy.
Heiligenblut: Holy Blood at the Mountain's Foot
Your destination, Heiligenblut, sits at 1,301 meters directly beneath the Grossglockner. This tiny village of 1,100 residents is one of Austria's most dramatically situated settlements, founded around a shrine built to house a holy relic. Legend tells that in 914 AD, Bricius, a Byzantine officer carrying a vial of Christ's blood, died in an avalanche at this spot. When his body was found, the relic remained intact.
The Gothic Church of St. Vincent, built between 1271 and 1460, contains the original Holy Blood relic and houses a masterpiece late Gothic winged altar from 1520. The church cemetery offers spectacular Grossglockner views, and the village has been a pilgrim destination for over 1,000 years.
Traditional village life continues here, where Bergbauern (mountain farmers) still work impossibly steep slopes using hay harvest techniques unchanged for centuries. Winter isolation cuts the village off by snow for four to five months annually, making the summer riding season all the more precious.
As evening approaches, experience the Alpenglow on Grossglockner peaks at sunset, church bells marking evening prayers, and the profound silence broken only by mountain streams and distant cowbells. The traditional Gasthof hospitality includes local specialties like Kärtner Kasnudel (cheese-filled pasta pockets) and Pasterze schnapps, named after the glacier.
Essential Information
The Grossglockner High Alpine Road operates as a toll road (€37 for motorcycles) typically from May through October. Weather conditions can change rapidly, with snow possible even in summer above 2,000 meters. Fuel up before starting your ascent, as mountain riding consumes more fuel and stops are limited. The road information hotline (+43 662 8042-4810) provides current conditions.
Remember that motorcycle performance decreases approximately 3 percent per 300 meters of elevation, and rider fatigue increases at altitude. Emergency shelters are located at regular intervals, but hypothermia gear remains essential even in summer. This is a journey best undertaken with a riding companion, as phone coverage becomes spotty above 2,000 meters and medical help is distant in the high mountains.

Day 8: Heiligenblut to Cornedo
The Dolomites Crown Jewel - Italy's Mountain Masterpiece
Down Through Lienz - Austria's Southernmost Gateway
Descending from Heiligenblut, you enter Lienz, Austria's sunniest city and capital of East Tyrol. This fascinating place holds a unique position in European geography—it's an Austrian exclave completely surrounded by Italian territory, created by the Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1919 after WWI when South Tyrol was given to Italy as war reparation.
East Tyrol became isolated from the rest of Tyrol, accessible only through Italy or mountain passes like the one you've just descended. Despite this political separation, the region has maintained its pure Tyrolean identity with traditional Schuhplattler dancing, Lederhosen culture, and distinctive Alpine architecture featuring classic Tyrolean farmhouses.
The area carries deep historical significance, built on the ruins of Roman Aguntum and serving as a medieval trade route connecting Venice to Central Europe. Count Görz ruled from here between the 12th and 16th centuries, and during WWII, the region showed strong anti-Nazi sentiment. The local dialect remains authentically Tyrolean German, preserving centuries of mountain culture.
Coffee Stop at Loacker near Sillian
Your border crossing timing is perfect for a visit to Austria's most famous wafer company. Loacker was founded in 1925 by Alfons Loacker, and their original factory sits right on the Austrian-Italian border. The family business still uses only local Alpine ingredients, including milk from mountain farms, to create their internationally famous Quadratini wafers.
Crossing into South Tyrol - A Cultural Crossroads
The seamless EU border crossing takes you into one of Europe's most culturally complex regions. South Tyrol (Alto Adige) is officially bilingual, with 69% German-speaking, 26% Italian-speaking, and 5% Ladin-speaking residents. The 1972 autonomy agreement protects German-speaking rights, which explains why every street sign appears in both languages.
You're traveling through the Brenner Pass region, the most important Alpine crossing for over 2,000 years. The Roman Via Claudia Augusta passed through here, and despite being in Italy, German remains the dominant language. This creates a unique cultural blend where Tyrolean traditions thrive under Italian governance.
Toblach (Dobbiaco) - Gateway to the Dolomites
Toblach sits at the linguistic crossroads where German, Italian, and Ladin cultures meet. This strategic location has made it crucial for controlling Alpine passes throughout history. The town has a remarkable musical heritage—Gustav Mahler composed his 9th Symphony here between 1908-1910, and his composing hut still overlooks the Toblacher See. His "Song of the Earth" was directly inspired by these mountain landscapes, and an annual Mahler Festival celebrates thisconnection. 
The town's three names tell the story of its cultural complexity: Toblach in German (the majority language), Dobbiaco in Italian (the official Italian name), and Dobbiach in Ladin (the ancient Rhaeto-Romance language). The Ladin people are the Alps' indigenous inhabitants, and their presence adds another layer to this already rich cultural tapestry.
Roman fortifications once controlled the Pusteria Valley from here, and it remained a crucial point on the medieval trade route between Venice and Augsburg. During WWI, fierce fighting occurred in the surrounding mountains as this became a front-line position.
Into the Heart of the Dolomites
Passing Dobbiaco Nuovo and Lago di Landro (Dürrensee), you enter the Dolomites proper—UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009 and one of the world's most spectacular mountain landscapes. The lake marks your entry into this geological marvel, where 250-million-year-old dolomite rock formed from ancient coral reefs creates the distinctive pale mountains famous for their ethereal light at sunrise and sunset.
Lago di Landro holds special significance as the watershed divide between rivers flowing to the Black Sea versus the Adriatic. During WWI, this became a battlefield where Italian and Austrian trenches carved into the mountainsides are still visible today. The via ferrata routes—iron-assisted climbing paths—were originally created for soldiers, and mountain huts served as military observation posts.
Tre Cime di Lavaredo - The Dolomites' Crown Jewels
The Tre Cime di Lavaredo represent the Dolomites' most iconic peaks—three massive stone towers rising 400 meters vertically from the surrounding plateau. Cima Grande (2,999m) is the highest and most challenging, Cima Occidentale (2,973m) was the first to be climbed in 1869, and Cima Piccola (2,857m) is the smallest but most technical.
The climbing history here is legendary. Austrian mountaineers achieved the first ascent in 1869, and the peaks have since become a laboratory for extreme climbing development. The north faces remain among alpinism's greatest challenges, and South Tyrol's most famous climber, Reinhold Messner, trained on these walls.
During WWI, the Austrian-Italian front line ran directly through these peaks, creating the highest battlefield in history with fighting at elevations exceeding 3,000 meters. Soldiers engaged in tunnelling warfare, blasting passages through solid rock, and the area now functions as an open-air museum where trenches, tunnels, and artefacts remain visible.
The narrow, winding access road presents its own challenge, with 10% grades and hairpin turns that require skill and attention. Altitude effects become noticeable above 2,000 meters, and weather can change rapidly with fog and storms appearing suddenly.
Lunch at Lago di Misurina
Lago di Misurina at 1,754 meters provides the perfect lunch stop surrounded by towering peaks. As the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, it reflects the surrounding mountains creating mirror-like photography opportunities. The clean, drinkable water comes from mountain springs and supports traditional trout fishing.
Since 1956, the lake has served as an asthma treatment centre where high altitude and clean air provide therapeutic benefits. Medical research continues on altitude therapy effects, and the location functions as an Olympic training centre where thin air benefits endurance athletes.
The surrounding peaks create a dramatic amphitheater—the Tre Cime di Lavaredo are visible to the north, Monte Cristallo (3,221m) dominates the western horizon, and the Cadini di Misurina present spectacular needle-like rock formations.
Passo Tre Croci - The Pass of Three Crosses
Passo Tre Croci (1,809m) connects the Dolomites' eastern and western regions through a spectacular mountain crossing. The three crosses at the summit traditionally blessed travellers on this ancient trade route connecting the Cadore region to Austria. The pass has maintained its importance as a pilgrimage path for centuries and held military significance during both World Wars.
The engineering achievement is remarkable—a series of hairpins climbing 600 meters in 8 kms with guard rails built into solid rock faces. Avalanche protection includes tunnels and barriers, and year-round maintenance is required due to extreme weather conditions. From the summit, 360-degree mountain views encompass Monte Cristallo massif to the north, the Sorapiss Group with its distinctive turquoise lakes, and the Ampezzaner Dolomiten spreading to the west.
Cortina d'Ampezzo - Queen of the Dolomites
Cortina d'Ampezzo stands as the Dolomites' most glamorous resort town, host of the 1956 Winter Olympics and setting for numerous James Bond films. The 1956 Olympics put Cortina on the international map, and the Olympic ice stadium and ski jumps remain in use today. The town will co-host the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics, continuing its sporting legacy.
Hollywood has long recognised Cortina's dramatic beauty. James Bond's "For Your Eyes Only" was filmed here in 1981, Pink Panther movies used the glamorous settings, and Sylvester Stallone's "Cliffhanger" utilised the surrounding peaks. An international film festival is held annually, maintaining the connection between cinema and these spectacular landscapes.
Despite international attention, Cortina has preserved its authentic character. The Ladin language is still spoken by many locals, traditional crafts including woodcarving and textiles continue, and mountain festivals celebrate ancient traditions. Architecture regulations maintain the authentic Alpine character while accommodating modern tourism needs.
Passo di Valparola - The Great Dolomites Road
The SR48 is one of Europe's most scenic drives, connecting the major Dolomites passes in a spectacular mountain circuit. Passo di Valparola (2,192m) earned its nickname "The Fortress Pass" from Forte Tre Sassi, an Austrian mountain fortress built in 1897. This strategic position controlled access to multiple valleys, with underground tunnels connecting defensive positions. The museum displays original Austrian military equipment, providing insight into high-altitude warfare.
The engineering marvel includes a series of hairpins with 15% gradients, retaining walls built into vertical cliff faces, and avalanche tunnels protecting the road from winter slides. The stone construction uses local Dolomite rock, creating a road that seems to grow from the mountain itself. The geological showcase reveals transition zones between different Dolomite formations, with fossil beds visible in road cuts and scree slopes constantly reshaped by erosion.
Colfosco - Ladin Heartland
Colfosco sits in the Val Badia, the heartland of Ladin culture where this ancient Alpine language and traditions remain vibrant. The Ladin people speak a Rhaeto-Romance language descended from Latin spoken by Roman soldiers. Five valleys maintain daily Ladin usage, preserving unique traditions distinct from both German and Italian cultures through oral history, storytelling, and songs.
Traditional Ladin architecture differs noticeably from Tyrolean styles. Ladin farmhouses feature distinctive designs with the stube (heated living room) as the centre of family life. Hay barns built on stone foundations prevent rodent access, and decorative elements show unique Ladin artistic traditions.
Modern preservation efforts include bilingual education where children learn Ladin, German, and Italian. Cultural institutes promote Ladin literature and arts, traditional festivals celebrate seasonal cycles, and the cuisine maintains ancient recipes and techniques passed down through generations.
Passo di Gardena - The Garden Pass
Passo di Gardena (2,121m) demonstrates the region's trilingual nature with its three names—Grödnerjoch in German, Passo Gardena in Italian, and the Ladin name reflecting the ancient language. Hotel Cir maintains mountain hospitality traditions dating to the 1800s, with the Cir Group peaks dominating the southern horizon.
The Cir Group presents distinctive red rock different from typical Dolomite pale colouring. Vertical walls rise 1,000 meters above surrounding meadows, creating a climbing paradise with routes for all skill levels. The area maintains remarkable botanical diversity with protected Alpine plant communities.
Through the Seiser Alm Approach
The valley route past Ortisei, Castelrotto, Telfen, and Seis takes you beneath the Seiser Alm (Alpe di Siusi)—Europe's largest high-altitude plateau and one of the continent's most spectacular landscapes. Ortisei stands as the woodcarving capital of the Alps, with a 500-year tradition of religious art creation where artisan workshops still hand-carve church altars. The Gröden Museum displays centuries of this craftsmanship.
Castelrotto offers 700 years of documented medieval history, with the tiny Marienkirchlein church on a hill serving as an iconic photo subject. Traditional festivals continue, and the famous Kastelruther Spatzen folk music group originated here. Elaborate folk costumes are still worn for celebrations, maintaining authentic Tracht traditions.
The Seiser Alm itself covers 56 square kms of high Alpine meadow between 1,680 and 2,350 meters elevation. This unique ecosystem represents the largest high meadow in Europe, with the Langkofel Group and Plattkofel providing a dramatic backdrop. Traditional Almwirtschaft (cattle grazing) maintains the landscape, while cable car access preserves the environment by prohibiting cars.
Völs am Schlern - In the Shadow of the Schlern
Völs am Schlern sits directly beneath the Schlern massif, one of the Dolomites' most recognisable mountain profiles and the symbol of South Tyrol. The Schlern's distinctive flat-topped profile at 2,563 meters dominates the Eisack Valley and appears on the regional coat of arms as a perfect example of Dolomite formation.
The cultural significance runs deep through medieval history. Oswald von Wolkenstein (1376-1445), a medieval poet, lived here and became the first German poet to write in vernacular rather than Latin. The Minnesingers tradition of courtly love poetry and music flourished here, and manuscript collections preserve medieval German literature.
Traditional village life continues with apple orchards producing 60% of Italy's apples, surprising quality wine production at this altitude, and traditional steep-slope hay farming. 
Local legends explain natural phenomena—King Laurin's Rose Garden explains the Alpenglow phenomenon, the Dwarfs of the Schlern represent traditional Alpine folklore, and documented 16th-century witch trials remind us of darker historical periods. Secret smuggling routes through mountain passes added adventure to centuries of mountain life.
Ending in Cornedo - Wine Country Finale
Your dramatic Dolomites day concludes in Cornedo, nestled in the heart of Alto Adige's wine region. This provides a perfect transition from high Alpine drama to gentle vineyard landscapes. Alto Adige DOC represents Italy's most northerly wine region, where Germanic wine traditions meet Italian terroir to produce exceptional Pinot Grigio and Gewürztraminer from over 500 wineries in a surprisingly small area.
A Day of Cultural Transitions
This 300-kilometer journey through 6-7 hours of riding plus extensive stops takes you through a remarkable cultural evolution. You begin the morning speaking Austrian German in East Tyrol, progress to bilingual German-Italian in South Tyrol, experience trilingual German-Italian-Ladin in the Dolomites core, and end with wine region German-Italian fusion.
The architectural evolution maintains consistency in Tyrolean farmhouses across borders while Italian influences appear in church architecture. Ladin style remains distinct from both German and Italian traditions, and modern tourism architecture successfully blends all three cultures.
You've conquered four major mountain passes with significant altitude changes, experienced high-altitude weather effects on engine performance, navigated narrow roads demanding precise control, and witnessed the transition from Austrian precision to Italian expressiveness in driving culture. The day presents mandatory photography opportunities at the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, perfect reflection shots at Lago di Misurina, and dramatic elevation changes at mountain passes.
From the morning's Austrian exclave through the heart of the Dolomites to the evening's wine country finale, Day 8 represents one of Europe's most culturally rich and scenically spectacular motorcycle journeys—a perfect blend of natural wonder, cultural complexity, and riding adventure.

Day 9: Bolzano to Bivio
Through the Heart of the Alps - Italian Tyrols to Swiss Graubünden
Starting Point: Bolzano (Bozen)
Your Alpine adventure begins in Bolzano, a fascinating city that embodies the cultural crossroads of Europe. This was Austrian territory until 1919, which explains why every street sign appears in both German and Italian—you're in South Tyrol, officially bilingual and proudly bicultural. The architecture tells the story perfectly: Italian piazzas nestled between Austrian-style buildings, creating a unique Mediterranean-Alpine atmosphere.
Just south of here lies one of archaeology's greatest discoveries. In 1991, hikers found Ötzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy preserved in glacier ice—Europe's oldest natural human mummy. For centuries, this was also a crucial stop on the medieval salt trade route connecting Venice with Northern Europe, making it wealthy enough to build the beautiful blend of architecture you see today.
The Great Dolomites Road
As you leave Bolzano, you'll follow the legendary SS42 through the Eisack Valley, riding along an ancient Roman route called Via Claudia Augusta. Emperor Claudius built this road in 46-47 AD as the first proper trans-Alpine passage, and medieval pilgrims later used it on their way to Rome. During WWII, this valley served as a major German supply route, adding another layer to its strategic importance.
Watch for sudden weather changes as you climb, and look left for Schloss Sigmundskron—that's Reinhold Messner's mountain museum housed in a 12th-century castle. The dramatic scenery around you has been shaped by both geological forces and human history spanning over two millennia.
Vinschgau Valley (Val Venosta)
The SS238 takes you into the Vinschgau, Europe's highest wine-growing region and home to some remarkably ancient settlements. The valley contains 3,000-year-old petroglyphs and original Roman road markers still visible today. You'll spot Churburg Castle from the road—it houses one of Europe's best-preserved medieval armouries.
Local legends add mystique to the landscape. The story goes that twelve noble maidens refused to marry invaders and were turned to stone—now the jagged peaks surrounding you. Germanic folklore also tells of ghostly riders racing through these valleys on winter nights during the Wild Hunt.
Marlengo (Marling) - Coffee Stop
This charming village is famous for its ancient irrigation channels called "Waale," still functioning after 700 years of continuous use. You've entered Germanic coffee culture now, so order a "Verlängerter" (Austrian-style coffee) rather than cappuccino. Try the local "Schüttelbrot"—a thin, crispy rye bread that's perfect for the road ahead.
Naturns (Naturno) - Roman Crossroads
The Romans called this place "Naturnum," and you can still see excavated villa remains in the town centre. The 13th-century church contains remarkable frescoes depicting the region's turbulent history, and there's even a 1st-century Roman administrator's tomb. This is also the birthplace of Reinhold Messner, the world's greatest mountaineer.
Notice the traditional apple orchards surrounding the town—this region produces some of Europe's finest apples. For a perfect riding snack, try some local speck (smoked ham cured in mountain air) or kaminwurz (chimney-dried sausage).
Schlanders (Silandro) - Last Italian Town
Your final Italian stop before the mountains showcases the region's most Austrian character. Churburg Castle here contains Europe's largest private armour collection—over 50 complete suits of medieval armour. The area has yielded Bronze Age finds dating back 4,000 years, while nearby tunnels hide the darker history of secret Nazi weapons testing during WWII.
Stelvio Pass (Passo dello Stelvio) - The King of Mountain Passes
Now comes the ride of a lifetime. At 2,757 meters, Stelvio is the second-highest paved pass in the Alps, featuring 48 dramatic hairpin turns on the northern side alone. The Austrians built this engineering marvel between 1820-1825 to connect Tyrol with Lombardy, creating what many consider the world's greatest motorcycle road.
Each hairpin turn has been numbered since the 1950s—a tradition that helps riders track their progress up this legendary ascent. The pass witnessed intense WWI fighting known as the "White War," where soldiers battled at altitudes so extreme that many died from altitude sickness rather than combat wounds. You'll still see Austrian bunkers and Italian positions carved into the mountainsides.
At the top, the stone customs house (Cantoniera) now serves as a restaurant where you can try "Kaiserschmarrn"—shredded pancake that's perfect high-altitude fuel. The view encompasses the Ortler glacier group, Italy's highest peaks outside the main Alpine chain. Be prepared for weather that can turn to snow any month of the year at this elevation.
Bormio - Renaissance Spa Town
Descending into Bormio, you'll find a Renaissance spa town with thermal baths used since Roman times. The Romans called it "Aquae," and it remained a free commune for 600 years until Napoleon arrived. Leonardo da Vinci visited the historic Bagni Vecchi in 1493, and Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph made the Bagni Nuovi his favourite spa retreat.
This is your last chance for Italian fuel prices before Switzerland, so fill up here. Stock up on Italian coffee and snacks too—Swiss prices are roughly three times higher. The modern QC Terme thermal baths are built over Roman foundations, continuing a 2,000-year tradition of alpine wellness.
Valtellina Valley
The SS301 takes you through the Valtellina, where terraced vineyards have produced Nebbiolo wine since Roman times. This is the birthplace of bresaola—air-dried beef aged in mountain caves that's become one of Italy's most prized delicacies. Notice the steep south-facing slopes with their ancient stone terraces and traditional "crotti"—natural refrigeration caves carved into the mountainsides.
Livigno - Duty-Free Alpine Paradise
This unique resort town has enjoyed duty-free status since 1805, when Napoleon granted it special customs privileges. No VAT means cigarettes, alcohol, and luxury goods at Italian prices without tax. The town was traditionally cut off from Italy six months per year until modern roads arrived, creating an economy based on contraband smuggling until skiing took over.
Try "Pizzoccheri"—buckwheat pasta with cheese and cabbage that's the Valtellina's signature dish. The local honey from alpine flowers and fresh mountain spring water make perfect refreshments for the road ahead.
Crossing into Switzerland: Ospizio Bernina
The Bernina Pass at 2,328 meters is an engineering marvel—the highest rail crossing in the Alps and a UNESCO World Heritage site. This is the only major Alpine pass crossed by railway in the open, with trains running through -30°C winters. You're now entering one of the world's most expensive countries, where Swiss Francs trade roughly 1:1 with USD but are much stronger than the Euro.
Lago Bianco (White Lake)
This glacial lake gets its milky white colour from glacial flour—rock powder created by grinding glaciers. Created in 1911 as part of Switzerland's hydroelectric revolution, it's fed by the Cambrena Glacier and provides some of the most photogenic Alpine scenery you'll encounter. The contrast between white glacial water and dark mountains epitomises classic Alpine beauty.
Pontresina - Mountaineering Capital
This village served as base camp for the first ascents of major peaks during the golden age of mountaineering (1850s-1880s). Europe's first climbing guides trained here, and Queen Victoria made it her favourite Alpine resort. The distinctive Engadine architecture features sgraffito decorative plasterwork, and the entire village is protected as a historic monument.
You're now in one of the last regions where Romansh, an ancient language, is still spoken. Traditional Alpine farming techniques are still practiced here—look for the distinctive hay-making methods that haven't changed in centuries.
Sankt Moritz - Playground of the Elite
The birthplace of Alpine tourism, Sankt Moritz became the world's first winter resort in 1864. It's hosted the Winter Olympics twice (1928 and 1948) and remains the playground of European royalty, Hollywood stars, and racing drivers. The town enjoys 322 sunny days per year at 1,800 meters elevation—what locals call "champagne climate."
Swiss private banking traditions started here, and the wealth is immediately obvious. Bentleys and Ferraris are everyday cars, and coffee costs 6-8 Swiss Francs. The Roman springs have been used since the Bronze Age, while the medieval pilgrimage destination of St. Maurice gave the town its name.
Don't miss the leaning tower—the only remaining tower of medieval fortifications.
Passo dal Guglia - Hidden Mountain Pass
This secret pass is known mainly to locals and motorcyclists seeking an alternative to main highways. The narrow, winding road requires full attention but rewards you with spectacular views of the Engadin valley and unchanged Alpine communities that seem frozen in time.
Final Destination: Bivio - Crossroads of the Alps
At 1,769 meters, Bivio is one of Europe's highest permanently inhabited villages, strategically positioned where three valleys converge. This was part of the Roman Via Mala (Bad Road), a trans-Alpine passage where medieval monasteries provided shelter for travelers. Traditional contraband routes to Italy passed through here, adding to its reputation as a true crossroads of the Alps.
Try the local "Capuns"—chard-wrapped dumplings that are a Graubünden specialty—and ask about the "Berggeist" (mountain spirits) that feature in local folklore. At this altitude and remoteness, the night sky offers incredible stargazing opportunities.
What You've Accomplished
In a single day, you've crossed from Italian South Tyrol to Swiss Graubünden, conquered the legendary Stelvio Pass and UNESCO World Heritage Bernina Pass, and experienced cultural transitions from Mediterranean to Continental to High Alpine environments. You've ridden through 2,000 years of human history, from Roman roads to medieval trade routes, from Habsburg spa culture to modern Alpine tourism.
The 280-kilometer journey takes 6-8 hours of riding time, with elevation changes from near sea level to 2,757 meters and back to 1,769 meters. You've encountered five languages (Italian, German, Romansh, English, and French) and witnessed landscapes that have seen Romans, medieval pilgrims, Alpine pioneers, and two World Wars.
This represents one of Europe's greatest motorcycle adventures—crossing the roof of Europe through terrain where every turn reveals another layer of history, legend, and natural wonder. From Ötzi the Iceman's homeland to the survival of Romansh culture, from Napoleon's Alpine crossings to modern engineering marvels, you've experienced the very heart of the Alps in all its complexity and beauty.

Day 10: Bivio to Sedrun
The Great Swiss Pass Marathon - Five Historic Alpine Crossings
Dawn in the High Alps
Today we begin at 1,769 meters in Bivio, where the thin mountain air affects both rider and machine. Today's route will take you across four legendary Alpine passes, through three distinct cultural regions, and along roads that have shaped European history for over two millennia. The Swiss Alpine weather system creates multiple microclimates ahead, so fuel strategy becomes crucial as you'll cover some of Switzerland's most remote territory.
The Albula Valley Descent
The ancient Roman route through the Albula Valley leads you toward Tiefencastel, the "Deep Castle" village named for its 13th-century fortress ruins. This dramatic valley formed part of the Via Mala, the Romans' most challenging Alpine route, where travelers faced what they called the "Bad Road" with justified trepidation. The UNESCO World Heritage Rhaetian Railway parallels your route, offering glimpses of the famous curved Landwasser Viaduct and the dramatic Schyn Gorge carved by glacial meltwater.
Traditional wooden "Stadel" barns perch on stone foundations throughout the valley, unique to this region where Romansh culture predates Italian influence. The ancient Romance language still appears on village signs, while "Engadiner" houses display their characteristic thick walls, small windows, and decorative sgraffito artwork. Local folklore claims the Devil himself built the stone bridges here, outsmarted by clever villagers who sent a goat across first to fulfil the supernatural contract.
Strategic Thusis
At the northern gateway to the infamous Via Mala, Thusis has controlled trans-Alpine trade for over a thousand years. This former Roman staging post called "Tosana" witnessed the founding of the Grey League in 1367, a precursor to the Swiss Confederation. Napoleon's engineers transformed the treacherous mountain path into a proper carriage road between 1818 and 1823, while three major railway lines still converge here beneath the ruins of thousand-year-old Hohenrätien Castle.
The village of Zillis guards Europe's most important Romanesque treasure: St. Martin's Church contains 144 painted ceiling panels from 1130-1140, depicting biblical stories mixed with local Alpine legends. This unique preservation shows how Christianity absorbed pagan mountain traditions along the medieval pilgrimage route to Rome.
Into the Via Mala
The thermal village of Andeer marks your entry into the legendary "Bad Road" section, where hot springs have provided relief since Roman times. The modern luxury spa built into the cliff face continues a tradition of healing that sustained countless exhausted travellers. Your route follows the exact path Roman legions marched, where medieval pilgrims prayed for safe passage, and modern engineering has carved roadway into cliff faces that once required rope ladders.
The hidden gem of Sufrersee, an artificial lake created in 1962, offers pristine Alpine wilderness at one of Switzerland's most remote accessible locations. The emerald waters reflect surrounding peaks where golden eagles soar and ibex navigate impossible terrain.
The Splügen Pass - Merchant's Highway
At 2,113 meters, the Splügen Pass represents the shortest route between the Rhine and Po valleys, used since Julius Caesar's legions crossed during Roman campaigns. Austrian engineers modernised the route between 1818 and 1823, creating the primary trade highway for German-Italian commerce. The dramatic descent into the Chiavenna Valley brings sudden climate change as you transition from Continental to Mediterranean influences, following 2,000-year-old Roman engineering through ancient stone bridges and impossible terraced farming.
The mountain village of Splügen controls the pass approach from the north, where Walser settlers from the Valais established their distinctive Germanic Alpine culture in the 1200s. Their wooden houses built on stone foundations were designed to move with avalanches, while the unique Walser German dialect still echoes through the valley.
San Bernardino Pass - The Saint's Crossing
Named after the 15th-century Franciscan monk who ministered to travellers, the San Bernardino Pass at 2,065 meters served as a crucial pilgrimage route to Rome and the Holy Land. Austrian construction between 1818 and 1823 created the strategic connection between Austrian Tyrol and Italian territories, while countless miracle stories celebrate divine intervention that saved travellers from mountain perils.
The descent through the Mesolcina Valley brings you into Italian-speaking Switzerland, where chestnut forests sustained traditional economies and Roman administrative districts left lasting cultural imprints. The village of San Bernardino preserves its 15th-century pilgrim hospice, while Grono's medieval foundations and wine culture represent the full transition into Ticino's Italian atmosphere.
Authentic Ticino Experience
Your lunch stop at Grotto val d'Ambra introduces you to one of Switzerland's most distinctive culinary traditions. These natural cave restaurants provided cooling storage for wine and food while serving as social centres where locals gathered for traditional meals. The risotto ai porcini, brasato braised in local wine, and polenta represent centuries of Alpine-Italian cuisine, while local Merlot wines and grotto-aged cheeses complete the authentic experience.
This tradition dates to Roman times, when natural caves provided food storage, later developed by medieval monasteries into sophisticated cooking techniques. Modern tourism has revived interest in these family-run establishments where seasonal menus reflect local hunting, fishing, and foraging traditions.
The Historic Battlefield of Giornico
On December 28, 1478, this small village witnessed Switzerland's most legendary David versus Goliath victory when 600 Swiss defeated 10,000 Milanese troops. The tactical genius of using the narrow valley to neutralise numerical disadvantage secured Swiss independence and created a national legend. Two 12th-century Romanesque churches with original frescoes stand alongside medieval merchant houses and a fortified 14th-century bridge, testament to Giornico's strategic importance as the Gotthard Gateway.
The St. Gotthard Pass - Switzerland's Sacred Mountain
At 2,106 meters, the St. Gotthard Pass represents the most significant trans-Alpine route for 800 years. While Romans never mastered this crossing, the medieval breakthrough of the 13th-century Devil's Bridge made passage possible and opened direct trade between German and Italian cities. The legend claims the Devil built the impossible bridge for the first soul to cross, but clever locals sent a goat first, cheating Satan of his prize.
The current bridge, built in 1958, is the fourth on this site, while the pass hosts multiple tunnels, the historic road, and railway crossings. During World War II, this became the cornerstone of Switzerland's National Redoubt defence plan, with fortress installations throughout the region.
Andermatt - The Alpine Fortress
This strategic town controls four major Alpine passes and has maintained military installations since Roman times. The fortress town served as a key position in Swiss World War II defence planning and remains a major military training centre. The return to Germanic Swiss culture brings traditional wooden chalets, stone churches, and mountain guide traditions, while modern development has created one of Europe's highest golf courses at over 6,000 feet elevation.
The Oberalp Pass - High Railway Crossing
At 2,044 meters, the Oberalp Pass represents the highest point of the Glacier Express railway, where the world's slowest express train crosses between Uri and Graubünden cantons. The engineering marvel of the rack railway climbing impossible grades requires specialised snow removal equipment and extensive avalanche protection. This high-altitude environment with its Alpine desert conditions can experience all four seasons in a single day.
Approaching Sedrun
The Surselva Valley, meaning "above the forest" in Romansh, brings you into one of the last strongholds of Switzerland's ancient fourth language. Near the source of the Rhine River, this traditional Romansh-speaking territory maintains relatively unchanged Alpine communities where Catholic customs mix with ancient Alpine beliefs. The village of Sedrun, an important station on the Gotthard railway line, served as a major construction site for the world's longest tunnel.
The Day's Epic Achievement
Your conquest of four legendary Alpine passes in a single day represents one of Europe's greatest motorcycle adventures. From morning's Romansh villages to evening's Alpine hospitality, you've experienced the full spectrum of Swiss mountain culture while following routes used by Roman legions, medieval pilgrims, merchant caravans, and modern adventurers.
The approximately 320 kms covered today included over 3,000 meters of climbing through landscapes spanning millions of years of geological history. You've crossed watersheds feeding three major river systems, experienced five distinct climate zones, and witnessed 2,000 years of human history from Roman engineering to modern tunnel systems.
Tonight, resting near Sedrun after completing what many consider the ultimate Alpine pass marathon, you've achieved something that would amaze ancient Roman travellers. What took their legions weeks to accomplish, modern adventure has allowed you to complete in a single day, conquering not just four major passes but the very heart of Alpine legend itself.

Day 12: Sedrun to Grindelwald
Into the Heart of Swiss Alpine Legend
Morning Departure from Sedrun
Your morning begins in the heart of Romansh-speaking Switzerland, where the Rhine River draws its first breath from mountain springs. At 1,400 meters above sea level, you're breathing some of Europe's purest air while experiencing the last moments of Switzerland's ancient fourth language.
The route takes you through Andermatt, that strategic crossroads where four major Alpine passes converge. This fortress town has guarded the junction of the Gotthard, Oberalp, Furka, and Susten passes for centuries. Behind the innocent facades of traditional chalets, Swiss military installations remain hidden, testament to this location's enduring strategic importance.
Through Railway History at Göschenen
Göschenen tells the story of Alpine engineering through its railway heritage. The northern portal of the original 15-kilometer Gotthard tunnel, completed in 1882, stands as a monument to human determination. Over 200 workers died during its construction, yet their sacrifice connected northern and southern Europe by rail for the first time. Today, the world's longest railway tunnel burrows 57 Kms through the mountain base nearby, a modern marvel that took 20 years and 12 billion Swiss francs to complete.
The village of Wassen offers a unique railway spectacle where trains spiral three times around the 12th-century church, creating the most photographed religious building in Switzerland. This engineering solution allows trains to gain altitude within the confined valley, while the church itself has been rebuilt multiple times after avalanche destruction.
Conquering the Susten Pass
The Susten Pass represents one of Switzerland's greatest engineering achievements. Built between 1938 and 1945 during World War II, this 2,224-meter-high crossing was constructed in military secrecy as part of the National Redoubt defence strategy. The dramatic ascent gains 1,000 meters over 15 kms through 17 major switchbacks, offering stunning views of the Stein Glacier and surrounding peaks.
At the summit, the Steingletscher Hotel has welcomed travellers since 1946, while walking trails lead to glacier viewpoints and a memorial honours the 600 workers who built this remarkable road. The geological formations here span millions of years, and the rich mineral deposits have made this area famous for crystals and semi-precious stones.
Entering the Bernese Oberland
The descent brings you into Switzerland's most famous Alpine region, where the dialect shifts from Central Swiss to Bernese German and the climate rapidly transitions from high Alpine to temperate valley conditions. Innertkirchen serves serving as the site of one of Switzerland's first hydroelectric installations from 1896.
The nearby Reichenbach Falls, plunging 250 meters down the mountainside, gained worldwide fame as the supposed site of Sherlock Holmes' death in Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Final Problem." Today, a funicular railway carries literary pilgrims to the spot where Holmes and Moriarty faced their final confrontation.
A Sweet Stop in Meiringen
Meiringen deserves recognition as the birthplace of meringue, that delicate confection invented here in 1720 by Italian pastry chef Gasparini. Multiple patisseries still claim to make the authentic original recipe, and the town has embraced its literary connection to Sherlock Holmes with a dedicated museum in the town centre.
The Gentle Brünigen Pass
At only 1,008 meters, the Brünigen Pass provides the day's gentlest crossing, separating the Rhine and Rhône river systems while marking the cultural transition into the tourist-oriented Oberland. This ancient route has been used since prehistoric times, later improved by Napoleon's engineers and developed for tourism in the 1850s.
Coffee Break at Rosa's Bistro & Bäckerei
Try their traditional Bernese Zopf braided bread or Nusstorte walnut cake while experiencing authentic Swiss village life.
Along the Turquoise Waters of Lake Brienz
Lake Brienz captivates visitors with its distinctive turquoise colour, created by glacial flour suspended in the pristine waters. Historic paddle steamers have operated scheduled services since 1839, while the lakeside village of Brienz has earned recognition as Switzerland's woodcarving capital. Traditional craftsmen still practice their art, creating everything from tourist souvenirs to professional violins.
Through Interlaken - Tourism's Birthplace
Interlaken, literally "between the lakes," pioneered mountain tourism in the 1800s when European royalty discovered its charms. Today, it serves as the adventure sports capital of Europe, where paragliding, skydiving, and canyoning attract thrill-seekers from every continent. Despite its international atmosphere, traditional Swiss crafts and culture survive alongside modern tourism.
Arriving in Grindelwald
Your destination nestles at 1,034 meters in a dramatic glacial valley, surrounded by the legendary peaks of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau. This authentic Alpine village transformed from a traditional farming community into a mountaineering base in the 1860s, yet it has preserved its Swiss character despite international tourism.
The Eiger's North Face, known as the "Wall of Death," dominates the village skyline. First climbed in 1938 after multiple fatal attempts, this most feared route in the Alps can be observed through telescopes positioned for tourists who come to watch modern climbers attempt the legendary ascent.

Day 13: Grindelwald to Michelbach
Alpine Lakes, Roman Ruins & Cross-Border Adventure
Route Overview: 280km through Swiss Alpine valleys, lakeside roads, Roman history, and into French Alsace Countries: Switzerland → France Highlights: Lake Thun, Roman Theatre of Avenches, Jura Mountains, Alsatian villages
🏔️ STARTING POINT: GRINDELWALD TO INTERLAKEN
You're leaving behind Grindelwald at 1,034m, nestled in the shadow of the Eiger's fearsome North Face where climbers have tested themselves against "the Wall of Death" since 1858. The descent follows an ancient trading route, and you'll notice architecture changing from dark wooden chalets with carved decorations to lighter-coloured buildings as elevation drops.
Interlaken literally means "between lakes"—positioned between Lake Thun and Lake Brienz at a crucial medieval crossroads. This town was rebuilt in the 19th century specifically for tourism, making it one of Europe's first purpose-built tourist destinations when British aristocracy "discovered" the Alps.
LAKE THUN SCENIC ROUTE: GUNTEN TO THUN
The 17km lakeside road offers constant views across turquoise waters to the Bernese Alps. Gunten showcases distinctive Bernese Oberland farmhouses—massive wooden structures with enormous roofs designed for heavy snow loads. Hilterfingen features fairy-tale Schloss Hünegg (1863), built by a Prussian baron who fell in love with the lake view. White paddle steamers you might see are originals from the 1900s, still coal-fired and operational.
Thun has guarded this valley for over 800 years. The Zähringer Castle (1180) sits visibly on the hill, built by powerful Dukes who founded cities across Switzerland. Look for covered wooden walkways along the Aare River—14th-century engineering still in use—and the river's incredible turquoise colour from glacier melt. Local legend speaks of the "Wild Man of Thun," a giant who could throw boulders across the lake; large rocks on the opposite shore are still called "giant's stones."
INTO THE BERNESE MIDLANDS: SEFTIGEN TO RIFFENMATT
You're riding through Gürbetal (Gürbe Valley), leaving high Alps for gentler Swiss Mittelland. Seftigen exemplifies Bernese farming villages with the bear coat of arms marking centuries of Bern city-state control. Wattenwil shows traditional Swiss barns with stone foundations and wooden upper levels, plus serious Swiss "Blumenschmuck" flower box traditions. Gurnigel enters Pre-Alps territory famous for "Alpabzug"—ceremonial cattle drives where decorated cows descend from summer pastures. Riffenmatt practices "Streusiedlung"—deliberately spread-out settlement to maximise land use.
COFFEE STOP: BÄCKEREI FONTANA AG, PLAFFEIEN
You've crossed from German-speaking Bern into bilingual Canton Fribourg. Plaffeien represents Swiss bakery culture where each village has its master baker, often family businesses passed down generations. You're in Senseland, where Sensler German dialect differs markedly from standard German. Try Zopf (braided Sunday bread), Gipfeli (Swiss croissants), and experience Swiss coffee culture's strong, small servings.
THE ROMAN DETOUR: AVENCHES
You're following roads first built by Romans 2,000 years ago, connecting Aventicum to mountain passes. Avenches was Aventicum, capital of Roman Helvetia with 20,000 residents when Rome ruled this land (58 BC - 400 AD). The Roman Theatre, built around 130 AD under Emperor Hadrian, seated 8,000 spectators and still hosts performances today. Aventicum was larger than medieval London, with running water, public baths, and paved streets when most of Europe lived in mud huts. The lone column standing in a field is all that remains of a massive temple complex that rivalled Rome itself.
LAKESIDE BEAUTY: SALAVAUX TO NEUCHÂTEL
Salavaux sits beside Lake Murten, site of Switzerland's crucial 1476 medieval battle where Swiss confederates defeated Charles the Bold of Burgundy. The gentle slopes host Vully vineyards producing excellent Chasselas white wines.
Neuchâtel, the Yellow Stone City, is built from distinctive local limestone giving the old town a warm, golden glow. This was seat of the Counts of Neuchâtel, then Prussian territory from 1707-1857. The Castle represents 1000 years of continuous construction, while the Collegiate Church contains Switzerland's most important medieval monument—14th-century tomb effigies of the Counts. Lake Neuchâtel is Switzerland's largest lake entirely within Swiss borders, with UNESCO World Heritage prehistoric lake dwellings.
INTO THE JURA: LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS
The world capital of watchmaking, where Omega, Tissot, and Tag Heuer perfected precision timepieces. This UNESCO World Heritage urban landscape represents the world's finest example of single-industry city planning from the industrial age. The grid street pattern and identical worker housing were designed for efficient factory operation. At 1,000m elevation, harsh winters actually helped watchmaking—farmers needed indoor winter work.
LUNCH STOP: LITTLE RANCH DROIT DE RENAN
A Western-themed restaurant in the Swiss mountains reflects Swiss fascination with American frontier culture. You're riding through the Jura range, which gave its name to the Jurassic Period because dinosaur fossils were first systematically studied in these limestone hills.
CROSSING INTO FRANCE: SAIGNELÉGIER TO ALSACE
Saignelégier hosts Switzerland's national horse market each August, featuring Franches-Montagnes horses—powerful draft horses perfect for mountain work. You're entering France's Franche-Comté region, historically part of the Holy Roman Empire until Louis XIV conquered it.
Seppois-le-Haut offers your first taste of Alsatian architecture with half-timbered houses (colombage) showing distinctive geometric patterns. Traubach/Soppe-le-Bas represent classic Alsatian villages where German and French cultures blend—local Alsatian dialect mixes both languages, architecture features steep roofs and timber framing, and this region changed nationality four times between 1870-1945. Guewenheim sits in the Sundgau region—Alsace's most traditional area where old customs survive.
🏠 FINAL DESTINATION: MICHELBACH
You've ridden from high Alps to gentle Alsatian hills, crossing cultures, languages, and centuries of history. Michelbach represents authentic Sundgau village character with half-timbered farmhouses, massive barns for storing crops, Catholic heritage marked by the church spire, and agricultural tradition in serious farming country where tourists are rare. Here you'll experience authentic rural France.

Highlights: Famous wine villages, Route des Crêtes, Lingekopf Memorial, Riquewihr, Struthof Concentration Camp

MORNING MOUNTAIN PASSES: COL DE HUNDSRÜCKEN & COL DIEBOLD-SCHERRER
Into the Southern Vosges
What We're Climbing: These passes take us into the Vosges Mountains - the natural border between Alsace and the rest of France, and historically one of Europe's most contested frontiers.
Col de Hundsrücken (748m):
This pass has been a military route since Roman times
"Hundsrücken" means "Dog's Back" in German - referring to the ridge's shape

Col Diebold-Scherrer:
Named after French soldiers who died defending these peaks in 1914-1918.
On clear days, you can see the Black Forest in Germany across the Rhine Valley


BITSCHWILLER-LES-THANN TO GOLDBACH-ALTENBACH
Industrial Alsace Heritage
This area was the heart of Alsace's textile industry - the "Manchester of France”. Coal and iron deposits made this an industrial powerhouse. German-French rivalry over these resources sparked wars for centuries


THE LEGENDARY ROUTE DES CRÊTES
One of Europe's Most Historic Mountain Roads
Forged in Fire: Between 1914-1918, French military engineers carved this 77km mountain road under constant enemy fire, building what would become one of Europe's most spectacular riding routes. Every curve was blasted and graded while shells screamed overhead, creating a strategic lifeline that connected mountain peaks at 1,000-1,400m altitude. The road gave French forces commanding views over the German-held Alsace plain below, turning geography into military advantage through sheer engineering audacity.
Where War Meets Wonder: Today's breathtaking panoramic views across the Rhine Valley to Germany and Switzerland were once battle-hardened observation posts. The unbroken vistas that make motorcyclists stop for photos were earned through the blood of soldiers who fought and died for these peaks. Countless monuments and cemeteries line the route, silent witnesses to the battles that raged across these heights while the road was still being built beneath the thunder of artillery.
Mountain Riding Reality: This narrow road was designed for military vehicles, not modern traffic, so expect tight curves and sudden weather changes that can shift from sunshine to fog in minutes. The engineering marvel that supplied WWI trenches now challenges riders with its original military specifications - built for purpose, not comfort. Every memorial stop along the route tells the story of soldiers who died so others could travel freely along these mountain crests that once divided nations in the bloodiest war in human history.

☕ COFFEE STOP: STOSSWIHR
Heart of the Battlefield
Stosswihr was completely obliterated during WWI fighting, its strategic position overlooking the Munster Valley making it a coveted objective that changed hands multiple times. Every building, every stone wall, every traditional half-timbered house you see today was rebuilt from absolute nothing by families who returned after the war to resurrect their home from the ashes.
Living Memorial: As you sip your café au lait and enjoy fresh pain de mie, you're sitting in the heart of some of WWI's most important battlefields. The traditional Marcaires (mountain farmers) culture that survives here represents more than Alpine charm - it embodies the stubborn determination of people who refused to let war erase their way of life. The village's reconstruction in traditional Alsatian style wasn't just rebuilding; it was an act of defiance against the forces that tried to destroy this mountain community.


HOHRODBERG & THE LINGE MEMORIAL MUSEUM
The Lingekopf - "Deadman's Hill"
Mountain Fortress: At 750m elevation, Hohrodberg commands breathtaking views over the Alsace plain that reveal why this high ground was so strategically precious during both world wars. The traditional Vosges farmhouses with their massive roofs weren't just built for snow loads - they represent a mountain culture that endured centuries of conflict. These thick walls and steep roofs sheltered families while empires fought for control of the valleys below.
The Hill of Death: The Lingekopf earned its grim nickname "Deadman's Hill" through unimaginable carnage from 1915-1918. Twenty thousand French soldiers died trying to take this single hilltop, their bodies scattered across positions that changed hands dozens of times. The preserved trenches at the Linge Memorial Museum still bear witness to trench warfare at its most brutal - young men dying for a few hundred meters of blood soaked earth that seemed to matter more than human lives.
Where History Bleeds: Walking through the museum's preserved trenches and examining soldiers' personal artefacts - their letters home, photographs, equipment - transforms abstract history into heartbreaking reality. The Chasseurs Alpins (Alpine Hunters) who fought here were mountain men themselves, yet even they couldn't master terrain that had become a killing field. Many local Alsatian families had relatives fighting on both sides, their divided loyalties reflecting the region's complex identity caught between France and Germany.

DESCENDING TO WINE COUNTRY: THE ALSACE WINE ROUTE
Niedermorschwihr to Kaysersberg
As you descend from the battlefields above, you'll witness one of Europe's most dramatic cultural shifts—from the harsh realities of war to the gentle art of winemaking.
Niedermorschwihr embodies perfect Alsace—half-timbered houses with red geranium window boxes and a distinctive onion-domed church. Unusually for this white wine region, locals specialise in Pinot Noir, claiming their soil demands this noble red grape.
Katzenthal ("Cat Valley") hides between vineyard slopes like a fairy-tale secret, watched over by Winkelturm castle ruins. Three-century-old family wineries here let you taste generations of tradition in every glass.
Ammerschwihr rebuilt itself after 85% wartime destruction, maintaining traditional architecture. The Kaefferkopf Grand Cru vineyard produces exceptional wines, and remarkably, winemaking never stopped even through war's devastation.
KAYSERSBERG VIGNOBLE - "The Emperor's Mountain"
This former Holy Roman Empire fortress still commands the valley with imperial dignity. Nobel laureate Albert Schweitzer was born here in 1875. The fortified bridge over the Weiss River is unique in Alsace—built to defend, not just cross. Wine cellars carved into hillsides date back to Roman times. At Christmas, this becomes one of France's most famous holiday markets.
LUNCH DESTINATION: RIQUEWIHR - "The Pearl of Alsace"
France's most beautiful wine village steps you into a perfectly preserved 16th-century world. Legend says Disney drew inspiration here for Beauty and the Beast's village. This wasn't always just a pretty village playing dress-up for tourists. Riquewihr was once a Free Imperial City under the Holy Roman Empire, and its merchant families traded wines across Europe, accumulating the wealth that built these extraordinary houses. The town's miracle is that it survived World War II intact—German officers reportedly wanted to preserve its beauty, making it one of the few places in the region that didn't need rebuilding.
Every doorway in Riquewihr opens onto a story. The Dolder Tower, built in the 13th century, still has its original portcullis, and climbing its stairs rewards you with views across the entire valley. The Thieves' Tower offers a grimmer glimpse into medieval justice—it housed the town prison and torture chamber. But these dark corners only make the light-filled wine cellars more welcoming.
Dozens of family wineries offer tastings of signature Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Every wrought iron shop sign is hand-crafted art, and you walk on medieval cobblestones. The cobblestones beneath your feet are the same ones laid by medieval craftsmen, worn smooth by centuries of wine merchants, pilgrims, and now, us!
AFTERNOON WINE ROUTE: RIBEAUVILLÉ TO THANNENKIRCH
Ribeauvillé, the "City of Three Castles," once controlled regional wine trade. Medieval fortresses crown the hills above, and an annual festival celebrates the town's minstrel heritage. Grand Cru vineyards produce Alsace's most expensive wines.
Thannenkirch sits at 520m elevation where cooler air and morning mists create different wine personalities. Less touristy and more authentic, locals still speak Alsatian dialect and maintain genuine connections between people and land.

COL DE FOUCHY - BACK INTO THE MOUNTAINS
Leaving Wine Country for History
The climb to Col de Fouchy (689m) takes you back into the Vosges, leaving the tourist trail behind. You'll witness another dramatic shift—from cultivated valleys to wild mountains, from picture-perfect villages to working communities, from wine culture to mountain culture and different Alsatian traditions.
Waldersbach is a peaceful village with strong Protestant Huguenot traditions, its mountain setting beautiful and serene. This tranquility makes the proximity to horror even more jarring.
Struthof Concentration Camp (Natzweiler-Struthof) was the only Nazi concentration camp on French soil. Between 1941-1944, 52,000 people were imprisoned here. Many French Resistance fighters were murdered here, and some of the war's most horrific medical experiments were conducted within these walls.
You'll walk through preserved barracks showing living conditions, see the gas chamber where systematic murder occurred, and experience memorial exhibits telling personal stories of victims. The mountain location creates a devastating contrast between natural beauty and human evil.
Understanding Alsace requires knowing its darkest chapter. These places exist so we never forget, so we remember the stories of both unimaginable cruelty and extraordinary courage.
FINAL STRETCH: LA PETITE PIERRE
Through the Northern Vosges
From Col de l'Engin to Lützelburg, you'll witness the landscape changing from high Vosges to the Northern Vosges Regional Park. This is sandstone country, where different geology creates different architecture, and castle country, where dozens of medieval ruins crown every hilltop.
Lützelburg sits in a strategic valley that once controlled routes between Alsace and Lorraine. The Marne-Rhine Canal meets the Zorn River here, creating a junction that supported industrial heritage of glassmaking and crystal production.
LA PETITE PIERRE - "The Little Stone"
Your Destination
This fortified village perches on a sandstone outcrop, its military architecture designed by Vauban, Louis XIV's master fortress builder. As headquarters of the Regional Park, it's the gateway to Northern Vosges protected landscape, maintaining authentic character as a real community rather than tourist attraction.
Distinctive red sandstone buildings tell the story of this defensive position that controlled the gap between mountains. The fortress still houses municipal offices, creating living history surrounded by protected forests and hiking trails. This is where authentic Alsatian mountain culture continues, unmarked by commercial tourism yet deeply rooted in centuries of strategic importance.

RIDING NOTES & PRACTICAL INFORMATION
Road Conditions:
Route des Crêtes - narrow, winding, altitude changes
Wine Route - heavy tourist traffic
Mountain passes - weather can change quickly
Village centres - very narrow streets, park outside and walk
Language - French is official, but German and Alsatian widely spoken

This day combines the absolute best and worst of human experience - from the beauty of wine villages and mountain landscapes to the horror of systematic murder, ending in a peaceful fortress town. It's emotionally challenging but historically essential for understanding Alsace's complex past and resilient spirit.


Day 15: La Petite Pierre to Steinfeld Monastery
Cross-Border Journey & Sacred Final Night
Route Overview: 320km through France → Germany → Luxembourg → Germany (Eifel Region) 
Countries: France → Germany → Luxembourg → Germany 
Final Destination: Steinfeld Monastery 
Highlights: American War Cemetery, Saar River Valley, Luxembourg countryside, German Eifel mountains

LA PETITE PIERRE TO GERMAN BORDER
Through Alsace's Northern Gateway
We're leaving the Northern Vosges Regional Park and heading toward the German border through increasingly gentle countryside that has changed hands between France and Germany multiple times.

ENTERING GERMANY: SAARLAND REGION
A Disputed Land's Complex History
This region was fought over for its coal and steel resources. The Saar Basin is one of Europe's most contested territories. It has had multiple nationalities - French 1918-1935, German 1935-1945, French 1945-1957, then German

LORRAINE AMERICAN CEMETERY: A SACRED STOP
Honouring American Sacrifice
Fields of Memory: Standing among 10,489 white crosses and Stars of David, you're witnessing the largest American military cemetery in Europe. These young soldiers, most barely out of their teens, died during the liberation of Lorraine and eastern France in 1944-1945. Many served under Patton's Third Army, pushing through the brutal winter campaigns that finally broke Nazi resistance. Each perfectly aligned headstone represents not just a casualty statistic, but a farm boy from Iowa, a mechanic from Detroit, a college student from California who never made it home.
The Wall of Missing Dreams: Perhaps most haunting is the Wall of the Missing, bearing 444 names of soldiers whose bodies were never recovered. These men simply vanished into the chaos of war - blown apart by artillery, lost in river crossings, or buried by the very earth they fought to liberate. Their families back home never had graves to visit, never had closure, never stopped wondering if somehow their boy might still walk through the front door.
Sacred Ground: The 113.5 acres of immaculate grounds represent more than military precision - they embody America's promise to never forget. French groundskeepers tend these graves with the same devotion they show their own family plots, understanding that these young Americans died not just for their country, but for the freedom of strangers in a foreign land. The visitor centre's battle maps show the terrible mathematics of war, but walking among the crosses reveals its human cost.
A Moment of Gratitude: Many visitors leave messages in the guest book, simple words of thanks that somehow seem inadequate yet necessary. These American sons and brothers lie far from home so that you can ride freely through the Europe they helped liberate.

INDUSTRIAL SAARLAND: CREUTZWALD TO SAARBURG
Through Germany's Industrial Heartland
Creutzwald: France's coal empire heartland where miners descended 1,250 metres into La Houve pit. The "Battle For Coal" (1944-1947) helped rebuild post-war France. 
Merzig: Strategic Saar River crossing controlled by Romans, medieval lords, and modern businesses for 2,000 years. Streets follow ancient trade route paths. 
Mettlach: François Boch started ceramics here in 1748 with his three sons. By 1809, they bought the 10th-century Benedictine abbey, housing Villeroy & Boch factory where monks once prayed. The abbey tower became their symbol, revolutionising tableware production from medieval monastery to global ceramics empire.


LUXEMBOURG: WASSERBILLIG TO ROSPORT
Europe's Wealthy Little Duchy
Luxembourg Countryside: Prosperity is visible everywhere - neat farms, perfect infrastructure, expensive cars. This tiny nation maintained independence while neighbours fought, then banking and financial services made it one of the world's richest countries per capita. Three languages (Luxembourgish, French, German) reflect its strategic position between European powers.
LUNCH: SAUERPARK BEACH ROSPORT
Artificial beach created along Sauer River very popular with German and Luxembourg families

INTO THE GERMAN EIFEL: THROUGH ANCIENT VOLCANIC LANDSCAPE
Ralingen to Eifel Mountains
Geological Transition: You're entering the Eifel region - an ancient volcanic landscape with over 240 volcanic cones, some active as recently as 10,000 years ago.
This area is famous for Jurassic period discoveries, unique rock sculptures carved by water and wind, and a protected landscape with rare plants and animals

🏰 MOUNTAIN VILLAGES: SCHÖNECKEN TO WALLERSHEIM
Medieval Germany Preserved
In Schönecken there is a 12th-century fortress overlooking village where they controlled ancient trade routes through Eifel mountains. The buildings here were made from local Eifel basalt (volcanic rock) and usually clustered together for mutual protection.
REFRESHMENT STOP: BÜDESHEIM
Authentic German Village Life

FINAL MOUNTAIN CROSSING: THROUGH THE HIGH EIFEL
Medieval Germany Preserved
High Eifel Mountains: At 600-700m elevation, dramatic weather changes sweep across volcanic slopes covered in dense beech and spruce forests. Ancient crater lakes (Maare) dot the landscape from prehistoric eruptions, while wolves have recently returned to these wild forests after centuries of absence.
Gonnersdorf: Archaeological treasure where Ice Age settlements reveal 15,000 years of human habitation. Some of Europe's oldest artistic representations were discovered here, proving these valleys have sheltered humans since the Stone Age through unimaginable climate changes.
Stadtkyll & Dahlem: Railway junction and market town serving scattered Eifel farming communities with traditional half-timbered architecture. Near the Belgian border, this area saw heavy fighting during the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945) before American forces liberated the region in bitter winter combat.


FINAL DESTINATION: STEINFELD MONASTERY
A Sacred End to Your Journey
Arriving at Kloster Steinfeld: You're ending your 16-day European adventure at one of Germany's most beautiful and spiritually significant monasteries.
KLOSTER STEINFELD: A SACRED ENDING
950 Years of Prayer and Hospitality
The Living Monastery: Founded in 1070, Kloster Steinfeld has maintained nearly 1,000 years of continuous religious life under the Premonstratensian Order - the "White Canons" dedicated to prayer, study, and community service. This architectural masterpiece blends Romanesque and Gothic elements in perfect harmony, while resident monks continue the sacred traditions that have echoed through these halls for almost a millennium.
Sacred Beauty: The Basilica of St. Potentinus stands as the monastery's crown jewel, its stunning interior adorned with medieval frescoes that have witnessed centuries of prayer. Surrounded by the peaceful Eifel mountains and dense forests, the monastery embodies the monastic ideal of finding God in both sacred architecture and natural beauty. The tradition of welcoming travellers stretches back centuries, making this the perfect sanctuary for weary journeyers.
Your Final Night: Simple monastic accommodation in ancient buildings offers a profound contrast to modern hotels - thick stone walls, basic furnishings, and the deep silence that comes from centuries of contemplation. At 7 PM, you can join the monks for Vespers, experiencing the same evening prayer that has risen from these stones for nearly a thousand years.

Day 16: Monschau to Rotterdam
The Final Journey Through History
Morning: Monschau, Germany - The Fairy Tale Town
The Pearl of the Eifel
Monschau obtained city rights in 1352, but the town really flourished as a centre for textile production, becoming one of the primary towns of the region as early as the 12th century. This medieval gem sits nestled in the Eifel hills, its cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses creating a scene straight from a Brothers Grimm tale.
What Made Monschau Rich: The Textile Empire
The town's prosperity came from its strategic position along ancient trade routes and its mastery of cloth production. The Red House or Rotes Haus, dating back to 1756, was the former home of the Scheibler family, who were prominent cloth merchants for which Monschau is known. These merchant families built the stunning baroque and rococo mansions that still line the narrow streets today.
The Rur River's Role
The Rur River wasn't just scenic – it was Monschau's industrial lifeline. The fast-flowing water powered the textile mills that made the town wealthy. Listen for the sound of water as you ride through – it's been the soundtrack to this town's prosperity for centuries.
Local Legends & Stories
The Witch of Monschau: Local folklore tells of a wise woman who lived in the castle ruins and could predict the weather by reading the mist rising from the Rur River
The Merchant's Ghost: Locals claim the spirit of Johann Heinrich Scheibler still walks the halls of the Red House, counting his textile fortune
The Secret Tunnel: Rumoured tunnels beneath the old town allegedly connected merchant houses during times of conflict
What to Look For:
The castle ruins perched dramatically above the town
Intricate baroque doorways and window frames
The old mustard mill (Senfmühle) – Monschau mustard is still made here
Half-timbered houses with their distinctive wooden beam patterns
The old town's narrow streets barely wide enough for a motorcycle

Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery, Belgium
A Sacred Stop: America's Gratitude in Stone
Dedicated in 1960, the cemetery contains 7,992 American war dead and covers 57 acres, administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission. This is one of the most moving stops you'll make in Europe.
The Ultimate Sacrifice
The majority of the fallen buried at Henri-Chapelle were killed during the Allied push in Germany during late 1944 and early 1945. These were the soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Bulge, crossed the Rhine, and pushed deep into Nazi Germany in the final months of World War II.
The Journey Home That Never Came
The first shipment of 5,600 American war dead from Henri-Chapelle left Antwerp, Belgium the first week of October 1947, with over 30,000 Belgian citizens attending an impressive ceremony. Many families chose to let their loved ones rest in European soil rather than bring them home.
What Makes This Cemetery Special
Created in September 1944 by the American army, it was originally much larger, covering over 56 acres and initially containing 17,323 US soldiers, 191 allied graves and over 10,000 German graves. At one point, it was the largest American cemetery in Europe.
The Design Philosophy
The headstones are arranged in gentle arcs across rolling hills, creating a sense of movement and peace. The chapel features maps showing the final battles these soldiers fought, and the Wall of the Missing bears the names of 450 soldiers whose bodies were never recovered.
Respectful Touring Notes:
Turn off engines when entering the cemetery grounds
Photography is permitted but maintain reverence
The visitor centre provides context and individual soldier stories
Many graves have personal items left by visitors – flowers, flags, challenge coins

Local Belgian Perspective
The Belgian people have maintained deep gratitude for American sacrifice. Local schools regularly visit, and Belgian families have "adopted" graves for decades, ensuring flowers and remembrance continue year-round.
The Road to Dutch Delights
Border Crossing: From Ardennes to Brabant
As you cross from Belgium into the Netherlands, you'll notice the landscape gradually flattening. The N671 takes you through the Belgian Ardennes' final rolling hills before the Dutch province of Noord-Brabant opens up into the characteristic flatlands.
The Invisible Border
Thanks to the Schengen Agreement, you'll cross the Belgian-Dutch border without stopping, but watch for subtle changes:
Road signs switch from French/German to Dutch
Architecture shifts from stone to brick
The landscape becomes more agricultural and organised
Windmills start appearing on the horizon

A13 Highway: Engineering Marvel
The A13 represents Dutch engineering at its finest – a perfectly straight highway built on reclaimed land and carefully managed water levels. This isn't just a road; it's a testament to Dutch mastery over their environment.

Afternoon: Pannenkoekenherberg Hollandershoeve, Reusel
The Dutch Pancake Tradition
Located in stunning outlying area, here you enjoy more than 80 traditional pancakes, with more than 400 years of history in the village.
What Makes Dutch Pancakes Special
Dutch pancakes (pannenkoeken) are kind of a cross between an American pancake and a French crêpe, and in the Netherlands pancakes are often eaten for dinner. They're thin, large (often covering the entire plate), and can be topped with anything from bacon and cheese to apples and cinnamon.
Traditional Dutch Pancake Varieties to Try:
Spek en Kaas (Bacon and Cheese) - The classic savoury option
Appel en Kaneel (Apple and Cinnamon) - Sweet and traditional
Gemberkoek (Gingerbread) - Uniquely Dutch
Stroop (Syrup) - Made with traditional Dutch syrup

Local Customs:
Pancakes are cut with the side of your fork, not a knife
It's perfectly acceptable to eat pancakes for dinner
Dutch families often make pancakes on Saturday evenings
The larger the pancake, the better the restaurant

Return to Rotterdam
The Final Stretch
As you ride north toward Rotterdam, you'll witness the Netherlands' transformation from rural countryside to urban sophistication. The landscape becomes increasingly organised, with perfectly straight canals, geometric fields, and the distinctive Dutch horizon punctuated by church spires and modern wind turbines.
Rotterdam: A City Reborn
Your journey ends in Rotterdam, a city that embodies resilience and innovation. Almost completely destroyed in World War II, Rotterdam rebuilt itself as a modern architectural marvel and Europe's largest port.
Harley-Davidson Culture in the Netherlands
The Netherlands has embraced motorcycle culture with enthusiasm. Dutch riders are known for their technical expertise, environmental consciousness, and strong riding communities. Your Harley dealership in Rotterdam represents this passion for American motorcycles adapted to European sensibilities.
Final Reflections
This final day takes you through three countries, each with distinct characters:
Germany: Historical depth and engineering precision
Belgium: Sacrifice, remembrance, and European unity
Netherlands: Innovation, organisation, and cultural richness

The routes you've traveled today – from medieval cobblestones to modern highways – tell the story of Europe's evolution from ancient trade routes to modern interconnected nations.
Practical Notes for Day 16:
Distance: Approximately 300 kilometers
Riding Time: 4-5 hours (excluding stops)
Best Photo Opportunities: Monschau castle overlook, Henri-Chapelle memorial, Dutch countryside from A13
Weather Considerations: Weather can change quickly in the Eifel; Dutch coastal weather may be windy

This concludes your 16-day European motorcycle adventure. From the first turn of the key to the final mile in Rotterdam, you've experienced the heart of Europe – its history, its people, its landscapes, and its enduring spirit of freedom and adventure.
